      <strong
        >Does a physician have a lien for services to persons with traumatic
        injury?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Any physician who renders services to a patient due to a traumatic
      injury may place a lien upon any claim, right of action, and/or money
      (except a claim, right of action or money accruing under Washington's
      Workers' Compensation Act) which the patient is entitled to receive from a
      person or the insurer of a person who tortiously caused the traumatic
      injury.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the value of the lien? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The lien is for the value of the services provided, together with those
      costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in enforcing the lien which
      the court may allow.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      The lien, however, shall not exceed 25% of the amount of any award,
      verdict, report, decision, judgment, or settlement the patient receives
      from the person or insurer of the person who tortiously caused the
      traumatic injury.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> The lien does
      not apply to any claim, right of action, or money recovered under the
      workers' compensation law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington law does not preclude a physician from contracting with the
      patient for medical services, and does not restrict the physician from
      collecting the remaining balance of the value of his or her services in
      the event a lien was filed.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> If
      the physician chooses not to file a lien, he or she is entitled to collect
      the entire value of services provided from the patient directly, before or
      after the patient has received the settlement or litigation proceeds.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How is the lien claimed? </strong></p>
    <p>
      In order to claim and be entitled to the lien, the physician must file a
      notice with the county auditor of the county in which services were
      provided within 20 days after the date of injury or receipt of services,
      or, if settlement has not been reached and payment has not been made to
      the injured patient, at any time prior to settlement and payment to the
      patient.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> The notice must be
      verified under oath by the person claiming the lien and must state:<sup
        ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The name and address of the person claiming the lien.</li>
      <li>The services provided.</li>
      <li>The identity of the parties.</li>
      <li>The circumstances of the injury.</li>
      <li>The name and address of the patient.</li>
      <li>
        The time and place where the alleged fault or negligence of the
        tortfeasor occurred.
      </li>
      <li>The nature of the injury.</li>
      <li>The name and address of the tortfeasor, if known.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How is the lien enforced? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The lien may be enforced by a lawsuit brought within one year after the
      lien is filed.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>

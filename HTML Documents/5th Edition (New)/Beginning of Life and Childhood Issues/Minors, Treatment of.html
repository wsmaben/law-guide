Minors, Treatment of
</h1>

<p><strong>What is the difference between a minor and an adolescent? 
</strong></p>

<p>
Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, an individual 18 years old or older is considered an adult and is fully capable of making decisions.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>   A minor is a person younger than 18 years old.  An adolescent is a minor that is 13 years old or older.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>   In other words: 
</p>

Term	Age	
Adult	18 or older
Minor	17 or younger
Adolescent	13 through 17

<p><strong>Can minors legally consent to their own health care?
</strong></p>

<p>
In some cases, yes. A minor can legally provide consent in the following circumstances:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the minor is emancipated (legally independent)<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  or married to someone over age 18.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> </li>

	<li>If emergency care is being given, and the parent or legal guardian is unable to provide consent.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> </li>

	<li>For birth control <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> and pregnancy-related care.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>   See BIRTH CONTROL; and PREGNANCY CARE.</li>

	<li>For sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV if the minor is age 14 or older.  See AIDS/HIV/STD.</li>

	<li>For outpatient drug and alcohol abuse treatment if the minor is an adolescent.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>  </li>

	<li>For outpatient mental health treatment, if the minor is an adolescent.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>  </li>

	<li>For any other care and treatment of a minor, consent of a parent or guardian is usually necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can a minor’s parent obtain copies of a minor’s medical record?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes and no. A minor’s parent can obtain copies of most of a minor’s record by signing an authorization as the parent.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>   Absent the minor’s consent, however, a minor’s parent cannot obtain copies of records for care and treatment as to which the minor had the right to consent.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>   See DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH CARE INFORMATION.
</p>

<p><strong>Can a minor 14 years old or older receive testing and treatment for HIV or other STD without parental notification or parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>   See AIDS/HIV/STD.
</p>

<p><strong>May birth control be prescribed for minors without parental notification or parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Generally, yes.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>   See BIRTH CONTROL.
</p>

<p><strong>May a minor receive pregnancy care without parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Generally, yes. An otherwise competent minor may receive pregnancy care without parental consent.
</p>

<p><strong>May an abortion be performed on a minor without parental notification or parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Generally, yes. <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>  See ABORTION.
</p>

<p><strong>May an abortion be performed on a minor against the minor’s will?
</strong></p>

<p>
Generally, no.  See ABORTION.
</p>

<p><strong>May a sterilization procedure be performed on a minor without parental notification or parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Generally, no.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>   See BIRTH CONTROL.
</p>

<p><strong>May a sterilization procedure be performed on a minor against the minor’s will?
</strong></p>

<p>
Generally, no.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>   See BIRTH CONTROL.
</p>

<p><strong>May a minor be involuntarily committed?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>  See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Involuntary_Commitment_Substance_Use_Disorder.aspx">INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT – SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER</a>; and INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT – MENTAL DISORDERS for circumstances under which involuntary commitment of a minor is permissible.
</p>

<p><strong>May an adolescent request and receive outpatient drug or alcohol abuse treatment without consent of the minor’s parents?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>   An otherwise competent adolescent may consent to and receive outpatient drug or alcohol treatment by a chemical dependency treatment program.  Parental consent, however, is required for treatment of a minor who is not yet an adolescent.
</p>

<p><strong>When must a physician provide notice of inpatient drug or alcohol abuse treatment of a minor to the minor’s parents?
</strong></p>

<p>
Any provider of inpatient drug or alcohol abuse treatment to an adolescent must provide notice of the minor’s request for treatment to the minor’s parents if:<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The minor consents to disclosure in writing; or</li>

	<li>Permitted by federal law.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notice, when required, must begin as soon as reasonably practicable, considering the adolescent’s immediate medical needs, be provided within twenty-four hours of the adolescent’s voluntary admission.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>   The notice must advise the parent that the adolescent has been admitted to inpatient treatment, the location and telephone number of the facility providing such treatment, the name of a professional person on the staff of the facility providing treatment who is designated to discuss the adolescent’s need for inpatient treatment with the parent, and the medical necessity for admission.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> 
</p>

<p><strong>May a minor request and receive inpatient drug or alcohol abuse treatment without parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes, an adolescent may admit himself or herself to an evaluation and treatment facility for inpatient mental health or an approved substance use disorder treatment program for inpatient substance use disorder treatment without parental consent. The admission shall occur only if the professional person in charge of the facility concurs with the need for inpatient treatment. Parent authorization, or authorization from a person who may consent on behalf of the minor is required for inpatient treatment of a minor who is not yet an adolescent.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>    
</p>

<p><strong>Is a parent of a minor who receives chemical dependency treatment without the parent’s consent liable for payment for the care?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes, a minor receiving treatment and responsible others shall be liable for the costs of treatment, care, and transportation to the extent of available resources and ability to pay.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>    See BILLING.
</p>

<p><strong>May the parent of a adolescent child initiate outpatient chemical dependency treatment of the adolescent without the adolescent’s consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>   A parent may bring, or authorize the bringing of, his or her adolescent child to a provider of outpatient chemical dependency treatment and request that an appropriately trained professional person examine the adolescent to determine whether the adolescent has a chemical dependency and is in need of outpatient treatment.  The consent of the adolescent is not required for evaluation if the parent brings the adolescent to the provider.  If outpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment is determined to be needed, there are strict requirements on the type and quantity of treatment that can be provided without the consent of the adolescent.  
</p>

<p><strong>May the parent of a adolescent initiate inpatient chemical dependency of the adolescent without the adolescent’s consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>    See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Involuntary_Commitment_Substance_Use_Disorder.aspx">INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT – SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>May a adolescent request and receive outpatient mental health treatment without parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes, if the minor is an adolescent.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>   Parental authorization, or authorization from a person who may consent on behalf of the minor, however, is required for outpatient mental health treatment of a minor who is not yet an adolescent.
</p>

<p><strong>May an adolescent request and receive inpatient mental health treatment without parental consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Under certain circumstances, yes.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>   An adolescent may, with the concurrence of the professional person in charge of an evaluation and treatment facility, admit himself or herself without parental consent, or authorization from a person who may consent on behalf of the adolescent, provided that notice of the adolescent’s admission to inpatient treatment, including the location and telephone number of the inpatient facility, the name of the professional person providing treatment to the adolescent, and the medical necessity for the admission is given to the adolescent’s parent by the facility in the form most likely to reach the parent within 24 hours (unless there is a compelling reason to believe that such disclosure would be detrimental to the adolescent or contact cannot be made, in which case the professional in charge must document the reasons in the adolescent's medical record).<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>   Notification efforts must begin as soon as reasonably practicable, considering the adolescent’s immediate medical needs.<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A minor who is not an adolescent may be admitted for inpatient mental health evaluation and treatment only by application of the minor’s parent, or with authorization from a person who may consent on behalf of the minor.<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> 
</p>

<p><strong>May the parent of a adolescent child initiate outpatient mental health treatment of the adolescent without the adolescent’s consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>   A parent may bring, or authorize the bringing of, his or her adolescent to a provider of outpatient mental health treatment and request that an appropriately trained professional person examine the adolescent to determine whether the adolescent has a mental disorder and is in need of outpatient treatment.  The consent of the adolescent is not required for evaluation if the parent brings the adolescent to the provider.  If outpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment is determined to be needed, there are strict requirements on the type and quantity of treatment that can be provided without the consent of the adolescent.  Parental authorization, or the authorization of a person who may otherwise legally consent on behalf of a child, is required for inpatient treatment of a adolescent under 13 years of age.<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<p><strong>May the parent of a adolescent initiate inpatient mental health treatment of the minor without the minor’s consent?
</strong></p>

<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>   See INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT – MENTAL DISORDERS.
</p>

<p><strong>Must child abuse be reported?
</strong></p>

<h1>Medical Assistants </h1>
<p><strong>What are Medical Assistants?
</strong></p>
<p>
Medical assistants (MAs) are health care professionals who have been specifically trained to work in settings such as physicians' offices, medical clinics, medical group practices, and other health care facilities. MAs are individuals who have been trained to perform administrative and clinically-related procedures under the supervision of health care providers.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>How are Medical Assistants different from Health Care Assistants?
</strong></p>
<p>
Health care assistants (HCAs) were only recognized in Washington State, and had a very limited scope of practice set forth in statute and administrative rules. HCAs were not permitted to perform any task which is within the scope of practice of a licensed health care provider except as provided in law. Under the law prior to July 1, 2013 HCAs were not permitted to perform tasks such as taking vital signs and performing simple tests (dipstick urinalysis, urine pregnancy test, etc.) because they were not included in the HCA scope of practice, but are included in the scope of practice of licensed health care providers.
</p>
<p>
Medical assistants (MAs) are much more widely recognized across the United States, and generally have a broader scope of practice. This allows MAs to assist medical practices in a wider variety of tasks associated with patient care. There are also a number of medical specialties which use certain assistive personnel who may or may not be trained as MAs, who nonetheless perform vital specialty-specific tasks.
</p>
<p><strong>What is new in Washington State regarding Medical Assistants?
</strong></p>
<p>
The Department of Health (DOH) has new statutes and rules which went into effect July 1, 2013which establish credentials for Medical Assistants in Washington. The laws created four categories of Medical Assistant which will be discussed in greater detail below:<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>MA-Certified (MA-C)</li>
	<li>MA-Registered (MA-R)</li>
	<li>MA-Phlebotomist (MA-P); and</li>
	<li>MA-Hemodialysis Technician (MA-HT).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happened to individuals who were Health Care Assistants July 1, 2013?
</strong></p>
<p>
Health care assistants who were credentialed and in good standing as of July 1, 2013 transitioned into one or more of the categories of MAs. Health care assistants in Category C, B, D, or F became Medical Assistants-Certified (MA-C).<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Health care assistants in Category A or B became Medical Assistants-Phlebotomist (MA-P).<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Health care assistants in Category G became Medical Assistants-Hemodialysis Technician (MA-HT).<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Multiple certifications as MAs were possible depending on the health care assistant certifications held by an individual. No health care assistant automatically transitioned into the Medical Assistant-Registered category.
</p>
<p><strong>Does every employee who interacts with patients or works in a physician's office need to be a Medical Assistant?
</strong></p>
<p>
No.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> A person employed by a physician or health care facility is not considered to be practicing as a MA if he/she performs only the following tasks:

	<li>Insurance reimbursement;</li>
	<li>Maintaining medication and immunization records;</li>
	<li>Preparing and maintaining examination and treatment areas;</li>
	<li>Reception;</li>
	<li>Scheduling;</li>
	<li>Telephone and in-person screening limited to intake and gathering of information; or</li>
	<li>Similar administrative tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the general requirements for Medical Assistants?
</strong></p>
<p>
Medical assistants must:<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have the ability to read, write, and converse in English;</li>
	<li>Have knowledge and understanding of the laws and rules which regulate MAs;</li>
	<li>Function within his or her scope of practice;</li>
	<li>Obtain their instruction from the appropriate delegating health care practitioner and demonstrate competency before performing new or unfamiliar duties which are in his or her scope of practice;</li>
	<li>Demonstrate a basic understanding of patients' rights and responsibilities;</li>
	<li>Respect patients' privacy by protecting their confidential information, and not using confidential information for any purpose other than legitimate patient care, or otherwise permitted by law; and</li>
	<li>Comply with all federal and state laws and regulations regarding patient rights and privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which healthcare practitioners are authorized to delegate tasks to Medical Assistants? 
</strong></p>
<p>
Healthcare practitioners who may delegate tasks to medical assistants include:<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Physicians and osteopathic physicians; and</li>
	<li>Other healthcare practitioners acting within the scope of their respective licensure including:</li>

<a name="Delegation and Supervision Requirements"></a>
<p><strong>What are the general requirements for delegation by a health care provider?
</strong></p>
<p>
The term "delegation" means the direct authorization granted by a physician or other authorized health care provider to a MA to perform functions within the MA's scope of practice.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Prior to delegating any of the functions within the scope of practice of a MA, a health care practitioner must, to the at best of his or her ability, determine that:<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The task is within that health care practitioner's scope of licensure or authority;</li>
	<li>The task is indicated for the patient;</li>
	<li>There is an appropriate level of supervision;</li>
	<li>No law prohibits the delegation;</li>
	<li>The person to whom the task would be delegated is competent to perform that task; and</li>
	<li>The task itself is one that should be appropriately delegated when considering that:</li>
<ul>
	<li>The task can be performed without requiring the exercise of judgment based on clinical knowledge;</li>
	<li>Results of the task are reasonably predictable;</li>
	<li>The task can be performed without the need for complex observations or critical decisions;</li>
	<li>The task can be performed without repeated clinical assessments; and</li>
	<li>For a MA other than a MA-HT, that the task, if performed improperly, would not present life-threatening consequences or the danger of immediate and serious harm to the patient. (For a MA-HT, that the task if performed improperly, is not likely to present life-threatening consequences or the danger of immediate and serious harm to the patient.)</li>
</ul>
<li>Note: The use of protocols that do not involve clinical judgment, and do not involve the administration of medications, other than vaccines, are not prohibited.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What are the general requirements for a Medical Assistant to accept a delegated task?
</strong></p>
<p>
A MA also has a responsibility regarding the performance of delegated functions. A MA may only accept delegated tasks when:<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The physician or other health care practitioner follows their requirements for delegation (see <a href="#Physician Delegation">Physician Delegation</a>);</li>
	<li>The task can be performed without requiring the exercise of judgment based on clinical knowledge;</li>
	<li>The results of the task a reasonably predictable;</li>
	<li>The task and be performed without the need for complex observations or critical decisions;</li>
	<li>The task can be performed without repeated clinical assessments; and</li>
	<li>For a MA other than a MA-HT, that the task, if performed improperly, would not present life-threatening consequences or the danger of immediate and serious harm to the patient. (For a MA-HT, that the task if performed improperly, is not likely to present life-threatening consequences or the danger of immediate and serious harm to the patient.)</li>
</ul>
<a name="Physician Delegation"></a>
<p><strong>Are there other rules related to a Medical Assistant accepting delegation of a particular function?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> In addition to the general requirements listed above, a Medical Assistant:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>May not accept delegation of acts that are not within his or her scope of practice;</li>
	<li>Is responsible and accountable for his or her practice based on, and limited to:</li>
<ul>
	<li>The scope of his or her education or training; </li>
	<li>The scope of practice set forth in law and regulations;</li>
	<li>The demonstration of competency to the delegating health care practitioner; and</li>
	<li>Written documentation of competency as required by state law and the policies and procedures of the employer of the MA.</li></ul>
	<li>Note: A MA who has transitioned from a health care assistant credential as of July 1, 2013, may not accept delegated tasks unless he or she has received the necessary education or training to safely and confidently perform that task.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are there requirements for supervision of Medical Assistants while they are performing their duties?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> A MA functions in a dependent role in providing direct patient care under the supervision and delegation of a health care practitioner. 
</p>
<p>
"Supervision" in regard to MAs means the supervision by a physician or other health care practitioner who is physically present and immediately available in the facility.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> (Note: A health care practitioner does not need to be present during procedures to withdraw blood, but must be immediately available.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>)
</p>
<p>
Some procedures, identified below, require a greater degree of supervision: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Direct visual supervision" means that the supervising physician or health care practitioner is physically present and within the visual range of the MA.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></li>
	<li>"Immediate supervision" means that the supervising physician or other health-care practitioner is on the premises and available for immediate response as needed.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>

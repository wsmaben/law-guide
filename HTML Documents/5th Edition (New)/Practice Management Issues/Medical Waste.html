    <h1>Medical Waste</h1>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there regulations which govern the disposal of medical
        waste/biomedical waste?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. There are specific state
      <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and federal
      <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> regulations governing the
      disposal of biomedical waste. State rules require that biomedical waste be
      disposed according to applicable state and county regulations.<sup
        ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup
      >
      Each county in Washington has regulations that require specific management
      and disposal of biomedical waste. Please check with your county health
      department for rules specific to your area.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is biomedical waste? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Biomedical waste includes:<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Animal waste, including animal carcasses, body parts or bedding of
        animals known to have been infected with human pathogenic
        microorganisms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Biosafety Level 4 disease waste which includes waste contaminated with
        blood, excretions, exudates, or secretions from humans or animals which
        are isolated to prevent contact with highly communicable infectious
        diseases designated as Biosafety Level 4 under CDC standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cultures and stocks, which include cultures and stocks of
        microbiological agents, human serums, live and attenuated vaccines,
        human blood specimens, including culture dishes, blood specimen tubes
        and devices to transfer, inoculate and mix cultures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Human blood and blood products, meaning discarded human blood and blood
        components, and materials containing these fluids.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pathological waste, including human biopsy material, tissue and
        anatomical parts that emanate from surgery, obstetrical procedures,
        autopsy and laboratory procedures (this does not include teeth or
        remains intended for internment or cremation).
      </li>
      <li>
        "Sharps waste" which includes hypodermic needles, syringes with needles
        attached, IV tubing with needles attached, scalpel blades and lancets
        that have been removed from their original sterile packages.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How must biomedical waste be disposed of? </strong></p>
    <p>
      All biomedical waste must be contained in a manner which complies with
      federal <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> and state
      <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> regulations. Contaminated sharps
      must be disposed of immediately or as soon as possible in an appropriate
      container.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Containers for
      contaminated sharps waste must be closable, puncture resistant, leakproof
      on the sides and bottom, and labeled with the word "Biohazard" and display
      the federally mandated biohazard symbol, or color-coded according to OSHA
      guidelines.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Other biomedical
      waste must be placed in containers which are closable, constructed to
      contain all contents and prevent leakage of fluids during handling,
      storage, transport or shipping, labeled or color-coded according to OSHA
      guidelines, and closed prior to removal to prevent spillage or protrusion
      of the contents.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> If outside
      contamination of the container occurs, the container must be placed in a
      second container that prevents leakage and is color-coded.<sup
        ><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Biomedical waste or any material in a container labeled as containing
      biomedical waste must not be compacted.<sup
        ><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Biomedical waste may only be disposed of at a treatment and disposal site
      that meets all applicable regulations.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
      Prior to shipping biomedical waste to a disposal site, the generator must
      sign a shipping paper which contains the following information:<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name and address of generator of the biomedical waste.</li>
      <li>Name of the generator representative signing the shipping papers.</li>
      <li>Name of the carrier transporting the waste.</li>
      <li>Date and time of collection.</li>
      <li>
        Destination and final treatment, storage and disposal of the biomedical
        waste.
      </li>
      <li>The general type and quantity of biomedical waste collected.</li>
      <li>
        Signature by an authorized representative of the biomedical waste
        generator acknowledging delivery and compliance with all applicable
        federal, state and local rules regarding packaging and containment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Signature by a representative of the company transporting the biomedical
        waste, acknowledging receipt.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are more detailed requirements for the safe handling of sharps and
      bloodborne pathogens as governed by the Department of Labor and
      Industries.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Also see
      <a

      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there special regulations governing the disposal of hypodermic
        needles and syringes used at home?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. State law prohibits intentionally placing unprotected sharps or a
      sharps waste container in a recycling container provided by a city,
      county, or solid waste collection company unless it is specifically
      designated as a drop-off for sharps waste, or in trash cans or bins if
      there is a separate collection service available for residential sharps
      waste.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> Residential sharps
      waste must be disposed of in accordance with procedures adopted by local
      solid waste utilities. These regulations vary from region to region, and
      the local solid waste utility should be consulted before disposing of
      residential sharps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Must a physician employer who has employees who may come in contact
        with bloodborne pathogens take special precautions with respect to the
        working environment?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Employers whose employees may come into contact with blood-borne
      pathogens must prepare and implement exposure control plans to eliminate
      or minimize the risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens and
      needlestick or sharps injuries.<sup
        ><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup

      Note that the Department of Labor &amp; Industries provides a free
      consultation service, which is available to all employers. Assistance may
      include advice on health and safety matters, an analysis of health and
      safety issues in the workplace, or help with a particular problem or
      question related to employee safety and health. Assistance may be obtained
      by contacting the Department of Labor &amp; Industries Safety and Health

        >What is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) is a federal
      statute which requires hospitals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the
        capability of the hospital's emergency department for any person who
        comes to the hospital's emergency department in order to determine
        whether an emergency medical condition exists.<sup
          ><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup
        >
        The appropriateness of a screening examination is judged by whether it
        is performed equitably in comparison to other patients with similar
        symptoms, not by its proficiency in accurately diagnosing the patient's
        illness.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        To provide stabilizing treatment to any person who comes to the hospital
        and has an emergency medical condition.<sup
          ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>What is an "emergency medical condition" under EMTALA? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The term "emergency medical condition" means a medical condition
      manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including
      severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical treatment could
      reasonably be expected to result in one of the following:<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Placing the health of the individual (or in the case of a pregnant
        woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy.
      </li>
      <li>Serious impairment to bodily functions.</li>
      <li>Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions, an "emergency
      medical condition" means that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital
        before delivery, or
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer may pose a threat to either the health or safety of the woman
        or the unborn child.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What does "stabilized" mean under the EMTALA? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The term "stabilized," with respect to an emergency medical condition,
      means that no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within
      reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during a transfer.
      In the case of a pregnant woman having contractions, "stabilized" means
      that the woman has delivered the baby and the placenta.<sup
        ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup
      >
      The stabilization requirement is defined in regard to a possible transfer,
      and without reference to the patient's long-term care within the hospital
      system.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >When may a hospital transfer a person with an emergency medical
        condition that has not been stabilized?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the EMTALA, a hospital may not transfer to another medical facility
      a person who has an emergency medical condition which has not been
      stabilized unless:<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The person or the person's legal representative, after being informed of
        the hospital's obligations and the risks of transfer, in writing
        requests a transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
        A physician has signed a certification stating that, based on the
        information available at the time of the transfer, the medical benefits
        expected from appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility
        outweigh the increased risks to the person, or in the case of active
        labor, to the unborn child, from the transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at
        the time the person is transferred, a qualified medical person, after
        consulting with a physician who determines that the benefits of transfer
        outweigh the risks, signs the required certification. The physician
        consulted must subsequently countersign the certification.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any such transfer must be an appropriate transfer, meaning that:<sup
        ><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The transferring hospital provides the medical treatment within its
        capacity which minimizes the risks to the patient's health and, in an
        active labor case, the unborn child's health.
      </li>
      <li>
        The receiving facility has available space and qualified personnel to
        treat the individual and has agreed to accept the transfer and provide
        appropriate medical treatment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The transferring hospital sends all medical records relating to the
        emergency medical condition, including records regarding the emergency
        medical condition, observations of signs and symptoms, preliminary
        diagnosis, treatment provided, test results, if any, and the informed
        written consent or certification for transfer, to the receiving
        facility.
      </li>
      <li>
        The transfer is effectuated by qualified personnel with the use of any
        necessary transportation equipment and medically appropriate life
        support measures.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Does EMTALA only apply to patients without health insurance?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. EMTALA applies to "any individual" who presents to an emergency room
      regardless of whether the patient has health insurance or not.<sup
        ><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>Does EMTALA create a national standard of care? </strong></p>
    <p>
      No. The aim of EMTALA is to address the problem of disparate treatment of
      insured and uninsured patients with emergency medical conditions. EMTALA
      does not create a federal medical malpractice statute, or recognize a
      separate cause of action for misdiagnosis or failure to recognize the
      extent of injury or illness and order additional diagnostic studies.<sup
        ><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Does EMTALA provide a private cause of action against an individual
        physician or a private clinic?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. EMTALA provides a private cause of action only against hospitals for
      any individual who suffers personal harm as a result of the hospital
      violating EMTALA.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> Courts which
      have addressed the issue have confirmed that EMTALA provides a cause of
      action against hospitals, not against physicians or private clinics.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Does a physician have any individual liability under EMTALA?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Any physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment, or
      transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition in a
      hospital and who negligently violates EMTALA's provisions, or negligently
      signs a certification for transfer, or who negligently misrepresents an
      individual's condition or other information is subject to a civil money
      penalty of up to $50,000 for each violation.<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
      If the physician engages in gross and flagrant or repeat violations, the
      physician may be excluded from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
      programs.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> In addition, a
      physician may be subject to malpractice liability if the physician's
      conduct violates the applicable standard of care and proximately causes
      injury.

        >What is the potential liability of an on-call physician at a hospital
        who fails or refuses to appear within a reasonable amount of time after
        being notified of the need to see a patient with an emergency medical
        condition and the patient is transferred because the risk of being
        without the on-call physician's services is greater than the risk of
        transfer?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A hospital on call physician who fails or refuses to appear, within a
      reasonable amount of time, after being notified of the need to see a
      patient with an emergency medical condition, is subject to a civil money
      penalty of up to $50,000 and, for gross and flagrant or repeated refusals,
      exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.<sup
        ><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup

      The physician authorizing the transfer is not subject to penalty.<sup

        >Must an on-call physician who is called to see a patient in the
        hospital emergency department assume the ongoing care of the patient
        after conducting an appropriate medical screening examination and
        providing any necessary stabilizing treatment?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, no. A hospital on-call physician who is notified that his or
      her services are needed to screen and stabilize a patient in the emergency
      department must come in, screen, and stabilize the patient,<sup
        ><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup
      >
      but is not required to provide ongoing care to the patient after the
      patient has been screened and stabilized. If, however, the patient is
      admitted to the hospital, and the on-call physician is the one who admits
      the patient, or is designated as the patient's attending physician, or is
      asked to provide care and treatment to the patient in the hospital, then
      the on-call physician would have obligations with respect to the patient's
      ongoing care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May a hospital on-call physician bill the patient or the patient's
        health plan for services the physician provides to screen and stabilize
        the patient in the emergency department even if the physician does not
        participate in the patient's health plan?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. A nonparticipating hospital on-call physician may bill the patient or
      the patient's health plan for the services the physician provides in the
      emergency department to screen and stabilize the patient. Under Washington
      law, health plans are required to provide coverage for emergency services
      necessary to screen and stabilize a covered person even when those
      services are obtained from a nonparticipating hospital emergency
      department if a prudent layperson would reasonably have believed that an
      emergency medical condition existed and that use of a participating
      hospital emergency department would result in a delay that would worsen
      the emergency or if a provision of federal, state or local law required
      the use of a specific provider or facility.<sup

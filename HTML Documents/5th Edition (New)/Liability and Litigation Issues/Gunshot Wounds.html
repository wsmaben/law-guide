<h1>Gunshot Wounds</h1>
<p><strong>Must a gunshot wound be reported?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Nonfatal gunshot wounds are notifiable conditions which must be reported monthly to the state Department of Health by health care facilities.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Notifiable_Conditions.aspx">NOTIFIABLE CONDITIONS</a>; and <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Reporting_Requirements.aspx">REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>What must be included in a report to the Department of Health regarding bullet wounds, gunshot wounds or stab wounds?
</strong></p>
<p>
The report required must include the following information, if known:<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The patient's name, address including zip code, telephone number, date of birth, and sex.</li>
	<li>Diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of disease or condition.</li>
	<li>Pertinent laboratory data (if available).</li>
	<li>Name of the principal health care provider.</li>
	<li>Telephone number of the principal health care provider</li>
	<li>Address of the principal health care provider.</li>
	<li>Name and telephone number of the person providing the report.</li>
	<li>Any other information the Department of Health may require on forms generated by the department.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are there mandatory reporting requirements for hospitals regarding gunshot wounds?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Hospitals are required to report to law enforcement authorities when the hospital provides treatment for a gunshot or stab wound. This should be done as soon as possible, taking into consideration the patient's emergency care needs.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> The report required must include the following information, if known:<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The name, residence, sex, and age of the patient.</li>
	<li>Whether the patient has received a bullet wound, gunshot wound, or stab wound.</li>
	<li>The name of the health care provider providing treatment for the bullet wound, gunshot wound, or stab wound.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are there any specific requirements if the patient states that her/his injury is the result of domestic violence?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. A law enacted in the 2013 legislative session imposes a new requirement on hospitals if a patient states that her/his injury is the result of domestic violence.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> In that situation hospital must follow its established processes to inform the patient of resources which may be helpful to assure the safety of the patient and her/his family.

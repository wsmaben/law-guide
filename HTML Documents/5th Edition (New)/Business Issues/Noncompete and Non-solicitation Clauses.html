      Noncompete and Non-solicitation Clauses
    </h1>
    <p><strong>What is a noncompete or noncompetition clause? </strong></p>
    <p>
      A noncompetition clause is a provision, typically found in an employment
      contract or a contract for sale of a practice, in which an employee or
      seller of a practice agrees not to compete with the employer or purchaser
      of a practice within a certain geographic area for a certain period of
      time following termination of the employment relationship or purchase of
      the practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Are noncompete clauses enforceable against physicians? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, yes.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Noncompete
      clauses are generally enforceable, as long as the duration, geographic
      area, and scope covered by the noncompete restriction are reasonable.<sup
        ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A physician should carefully review any contract containing a noncompete
      clause before signing to ensure that the duration, and geographic area,
      and scope of the noncompete area restriction are acceptable.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is a non-solicitation clause? </strong></p>
    <p>
      A non-solicitation clause is a provision, typically found in an employment
      contract, or contract for sale of a practice, in which an employee or
      seller of a practice agrees not to solicit business from patients or
      referral sources of the employer or purchaser of the practice following
      termination of the employment relationship or purchase of the practice.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are non-solicitation clauses enforceable? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Generally, yes. Non-solicitation clauses are a type of covenant not to
      compete, and are therefore generally enforceable as long as they are
      reasonable.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Is the law around noncompetition and non-solicitation clauses changing
        in 2020?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Washington passed a new law that, starting January 1, 2020,
      substantially changes the noncompete law in Washington.<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
      The new law applies to both new and existing covenants (unless a lawsuit
      is started over the existing covenant prior to January 1, 2020). However,
      with respect to an existing covenant, the employee can only bring a claim
      if the employer is "enforcing" the covenant. Enforcing is not defined, but
      it probably means something in between doing nothing and suing the
      employee (i.e., communicating an expectation of compliance, demanding
      compliance, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The new law only applies to noncompetition covenants, which does not
      include (a) a nonsolicitation agreement (narrowly defined); (b) a
      confidentiality agreement; (c) a covenant prohibiting use or disclosure of
      trade secrets or inventions; (d) a covenant entered into by a person
      purchasing or selling the goodwill of a business or otherwise acquiring or
      disposing of an ownership interest; or (e) certain covenants entered into
      by a franchisee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new law prohibits noncompetition covenants unless the party seeking
      enforcement paid the employee more than $100,000 in the previous year
      (annualized for partial years) as reported in box 1 of the W-2 (which box
      1 excludes retirement contributions). The $100,000 threshold will get
      adjusted every year for inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, for employees above this threshold, the new law still
      imposes requirements regarding noncompetition covenants, which generally
      include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Disclosure: The employer must disclose the terms of covenant in writing
        no later than the time of the acceptance of the offer of employment
      </li>
      <li>
        Layoffs: If an employee is laid off, enforcement of the covenant must
        include compensation payable to the laid off employee during the time of
        enforcement. The compensation is the employee's base salary offset by
        other earnings. The law does not define layoff.
      </li>
      <li>
        Duration: A duration of more than 18 months is presumed void and
        unreasonable, which presumption the employer can rebut with clear and
        convincing evidence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consideration: The covenant has to be supported by consideration. For a
        new employee, this is the initial hiring (assuming the employee signs
        the noncompete before the first day of work). For an existing employee,
        the new condition might be a bonus, promotion, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In a major change, if a court modifies a noncompetition covenant in any
      way (i.e., reduces a 25 mile radius to 20 miles, or anything), the
      employer has to pay the employee's damages (with a minimum amount of
      $5,000) plus the employee's attorney fees, costs, and expenses. The
      enforceability of noncompete in the health care setting is very
      unpredictable, which creates a risk for the parties. For example, in the
      Emerick v. Cardiac Study Center, Inc., P.S., 189 Wn. App. 711 (2015), the
      court found that a non-compete for a cardiologist covering Pierce
      County/Federal Way was unreasonably and so the court reduced it down to a
      2 mile radius around each clinic, allowed the cardiologist to work in any
      hospital, and added other exceptions. In that case, the employee still had
      to pay the employer's attorney fees (which amounted to more than
      $200,000). Under the new law, the employer would have had to pay the
      employee's fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law also applies to independent contractors (very narrowly defined),
      but in different ways that are beyond the scope of this article.

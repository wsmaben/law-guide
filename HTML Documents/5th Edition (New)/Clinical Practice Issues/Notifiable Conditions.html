<p><strong>How must reports of notifiable conditions be made?</strong></p>
<p>
Conditions listed as immediately notifiable must be reported by telephone or by secure facsimile copy or secure electronic transmission of a written case report. A party sending information by facsimile or electronic transmission during business hours must confirm immediate receipt by a live person.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Conditions designated as notifiable within 24 hours must be reported to the local health officer or the Department of Health (as specified in the above list) within 24 hours of diagnosis or suspected diagnosis. Reports during normal business hours may be sent by secure electronic transmission, telephone, or secure facsimile copy.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Conditions listed as notifiable within three business days must be reported by written case report, secure electronic transmission, or secure facsimile copy.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Conditions listed as notifiable on a monthly basis must also be reported by written case report, secure electronic transmission, or secure facsimile copy.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
For conditions designated as notifiable to the local health department, a physician must notify the state Department of Health when the local health department is closed or its representatives are unavailable at the time a case or suspected case of an immediately notifiable condition or an outbreak or suspected outbreak of a communicable disease occurs.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> The Department of Health has a 24-hour hotline number, (206) 418-5500 or (877) 539-4344 (Toll-free), for reporting notifiable conditions, outbreaks, or suspected outbreaks.
</p>
<p><strong>What must a report of a notifiable condition contain?
</strong></p>
<p>
For each notifiable condition, physicians must provide the following information for each case or suspected case:<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Patient name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and sex.</li>
	<li>Diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of disease or condition.</li>
	<li>Pertinent laboratory data, if available.</li>
	<li>Name and address or telephone number of the principal health care provider.</li>
	<li>Name and address or telephone number of the person providing the report.</li>
	<li>Any other information the Department of Health may require on forms it generates.</li>
	<li>Any other information of epidemiological or public health value the local health officer or state health officer may require.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What else must a physician do to prevent the spread of communicable diseases?
</strong></p>
<p>
See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Communicable_Diseases.aspx">COMMUNICABLE DISEASES</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Are there penalties for failing to file a required report?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Failure to file a required report can constitute unprofessional conduct which may result in disciplinary action.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Unprofessional_Conduct.aspx">UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</a>. Also, if the failure to file a required report is the proximate cause of an actionable injury, it could subject the physician to civil liability.

    <p><strong>What is a physician assistant (PA)? </strong></p>
    <p>
      A PA is a health care provider who is licensed by the Medical Quality
      Assurance Commission (MQAC) to practice medicine to a limited extent only
      under the supervision and control of a physician and who is academically
      and clinically prepared to provide health care services and perform
      diagnostic, therapeutic, preventative, and health maintenance
      services.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> All PAs must clearly
      identify himself or herself as a physician assistant and must
      appropriately display on his or he person identification as a physician
      assistant.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What is the difference between a physician assistant (PA) and a
        certified physician assistant (PA-C)?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A certified physician assistant (PA-C) is an individual who has
      successfully completed an accredited and approved physician assistant
      program and has passed the initial national boards examination.<sup

      <strong
        >A "noncertified" physician assistant (PA) is an individual who
        either:<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Successfully completed an accredited and approved physician assistant
        program, is eligible for the national boards examination, and was
        licensed in Washington State prior to July 1, 1999;
      </li>
      <li>
        Qualified based on work experience and education and was licensed prior
        to July 1, 1989;
      </li>
      <li>
        Graduated from an international medical school and was licensed prior to
        July 1, 1989; or,
      </li>
      <li>Holds an interim permit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Effective July 1, 1999, an individual applying for a license as a
      physician assistant must have graduated from an accredited and approved
      physician assistant program and must be certified by successful completion
      of the national board examinations.<sup
        ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup

      Applicants for an interim permit will have one year from issuance of the
      interim permit to successfully complete the examination.<sup

      <strong
        >May physician assistants sign documents ordinarily signed by a licensed
        physician?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. A PA may sign and attest to any document that might ordinarily be
      signed by a physician, including (but not limited to) birth and death
      certificates.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    </p>

        >Can military experience be used to become licensed as a PA in
        Washington?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. An applicant for a license as a PA who has military training or
      experience satisfies the training or experience requirements to become
      licensed as a PA unless the Medical Quality Assurance Commission
      determines that the military training or experience is not substantially
      equivalent to the standards of this state.<sup

    <p>
      <strong
        >What must a physician do to utilize a PA in the physician's practice?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A physician who wishes to use a licensed PA must obtain approval from the
      MQAC.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Before commencing practice,
      a licensed PA must apply to the MQAC for permission to be employed or
      supervised by a physician or physician group. The physician or physician
      group and the licensed PA must jointly submit to the MQAC a practice
      arrangement plan which delineates the manner and extent to which the PA
      will practice and be supervised.<sup
        ><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup
      >
      A new practice plan must be submitted if a PA who is currently
      credentialed desires to become associated with another physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      A licensed PA may practice medicine only with the MQAC's approval of the
      practice arrangement plan and only to the extent permitted by the MQAC. A
      licensed PA who has not received approval of the practice arrangement plan
      may not practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May a PA practice in a manner inconsistent with an approved practice
        arrangement plan?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Whenever a PA practices in a manner inconsistent with the practice
      arrangement plan approved by the MQAC, the MQAC may take disciplinary
      action.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What is the supervising physician's liability for the acts and
        omissions of a PA?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the supervising physician and the PA shall retain professional and
      personal responsibility for the acts and omissions of the PA.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A supervising physician may be disciplined for aiding and abetting the
      unlicensed practice of medicine if the PA is permitted to practice
      medicine beyond the scope of practice approved by the MQAC.<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>May a PA prescribe legend drugs? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Yes. A certified physician assistant may prescribe legend drugs consistent
      with the scope of practice in an approved delegation agreement.<sup
        ><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>May a PA prescribe controlled substances? </strong></p>
    <p>
      A certified physician assistant may prescribe controlled substances.<sup

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Whose DEA number must a PA use if approved by the MQAC to prescribe
        controlled substances?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      On written prescriptions for Schedule II through V controlled substances,
      a PA who is approved by the MQAC to prescribe controlled substances must
      include the PA's DEA registration number or, if none, the sponsoring
      physician's DEA registration number, followed by the letters "P.A." (or if
      the PA is a certified PA, the letters "P.A.-C"), and the PA's license
      number.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May a PA practice in a remote location other than where the supervising
        physician is located?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but only under limited circumstances and with MQAC approval.<sup
        ><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup
      >
      A physician assistant who holds an interim permit may not practice in a
      remote location.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> The MQAC may
      approve a PA's practice in a remote site if:<sup
        ><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a demonstrated need for such utilization.</li>
      <li>
        Adequate provision exists for immediate communication between the
        supervising physician and the PA.
      </li>
      <li>
        The responsible sponsoring or supervising physician spends 10% of the
        PA's practice time in the remote site, or in the case of part-time or
        unique practice settings, demonstrates that adequate supervision is
        being maintained by an alternate method.
      </li>
      <li>
        The names of the sponsoring or supervising physician and the PA are
        prominently displayed at the entrance to the clinic or in the reception
        area.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Must a physician review and countersign chart entries made by a PA?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A physician may sign and attest to any document that might ordinarily be
      signed by a licensed physician, but is not required.<sup
        ><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What should a supervising physician do when unable to supervise due to
        a temporary absence?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The supervising physician must identify a designated alternate supervisor
      who will take over supervisory and review responsibilities in the
      supervising physician's absence.<sup
        ><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What are the responsibilities of a nonsupervising physician who
        utilizes or advises a PA?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A nonsponsoring physician who knowingly requests a PA to render care to a
      patient or knowingly consults with a PA is responsible for the care
      provided by the PA.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What happens if the sponsoring or supervising physician's practice is
        limited by disciplinary action?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      To the extent the sponsoring or supervising physician's practice has been
      limited by disciplinary action, the PA's practice is similarly limited
      while working under that physician's sponsorship or supervision.<sup
        ><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there requirements for continuing medical education for PAs?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Physician assistants must complete one hundred (100) hours of
      continuing medical education every two (2) years.<sup

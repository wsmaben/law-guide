      Medicare - Medicaid Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions (Stark Laws)
    </h1>
    <p>
      NOTE: Analysis of potential physician self-referral issues is very complex
      and fact-specific. The Stark law and how it is interpreted changes
      frequently. Almost all of the exceptions to the laws and regulations
      prohibiting self-referral require compliance with multiple specific
      conditions. Physicians are well-advised to seek legal advice before
      assuming that their ownership or investment interests or compensation
      arrangements with referral sources do not violate the Stark laws. The
      Legal Resource Center of the Washington State Medical Association (<a
        href="https://wsma.org"
        >https://wsma.org</a
      >) can assist you in identifying attorneys experienced in Stark and other
      self-referral questions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the Stark law? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The phrase "Stark" law refers to a law named after the former congressman
      from California, Peter Stark. Sometimes people refer to Stark I, Stark II,
      and Stark II, which refer to a series of regulations implementing the law.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What does the Stark laws prohibit? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Unless an exception applies, a physician who has a direct or indirect
      financial relationship with an entity (whether through ownership or
      compensation), or who has an immediate family member who has a direct or
      indirect financial relationship with the entity, may not make a referral
      to that entity for the furnishing of designated health services (DHS)
      payable by Medicare or Medicaid.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
      Stark also prohibits an entity providing the DHS from billing for any DHS
      furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral.<sup
        ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>Does intent matter? </strong></p>
    <p>
      No. Unlike the False Claims Act and federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the
      Stark law is a strict liability statute. No intent to violate the law is
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What are the penalties for violating the Stark laws? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The sanctions for violations of the Stark laws are harsh and include the
      following: (1) no payment for a DHS furnished pursuant to a prohibited
      referral; <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> (2) an obligation to
      repay all amounts improperly billed;
      <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> (3) civil money penalties of up
      to $15,000 per each improperly billed service;
      <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> (4) civil money penalties of up
      to $100,000 against any physician or entity that enters into any
      circumvention arrangement or scheme which the physician or entity knew or
      should have known has a principal purpose of assuring referrals;
      <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> (5) civil money penalties of up
      to $10,000 each day for which a required report has not been made;
      <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> (6) exclusion from participation
      in Medicare or Medicaid; <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> and/or
      (7) assessment of not more than three times the amount claimed for each
      item or service improperly claimed.<sup
        ><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Is there a way to limit potential penalties for violating the Stark
        law?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Potentially. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has
      developed the Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol (SRDP) for providers who
      have discovered Stark law violations and wish to make a voluntary
      disclosure, resolve their repayment obligations with CMS, and potentially
      receive a reduction in the amounts due and owing as a result of the
      violation.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Providers seeking
      to utilize this option should seek the advice of legal counsel.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What are designated health services or DHS? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The "designated health services" (DHS) encompassed in the Stark laws and
      regulations include the following items or services when payable by
      Medicare or Medicaid:<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clinical laboratory services.*</li>
      <li>
        Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and outpatient speech-language
        pathology services.*
      </li>
      <li>
        Radiology services, including x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging,
        computerized axial tomography scans, ultrasound services, and nuclear
        medicine.*
      </li>
      <li>
        Note that with regard to certain imaging services, including MRI, CT,
        and PET scans, the referring physician must provide written notice
        (which must meet certain requirements set forth in regulations) to the
        patient at the time of the referral that the patient may receive the
        same service from a person other than the referring physician or the
        physician's group.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>Radiation therapy services and supplies.*</li>
      <li>Durable medical equipment and supplies.</li>
      <li>Parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies.</li>
      <li>Prosthetics, orthotics, and prosthetic devices and supplies.</li>
      <li>Home health services.</li>
      <li>Outpatient prescription drugs.</li>
      <li>Inpatient and outpatient hospital services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      *The list of CPT and HCPCS codes for the specific services that are
      considered DHS under the above categories that are followed by an asterisk
      is updated annually in the physician fee schedule final rule and on the
      CMS website.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there are any exceptions to the self-referral prohibitions of the
        Stark laws?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Stark has exceptions that cover either specific referrals or
      financial relationships (i.e., if there is no financial relationship
      between the parties, then Stark does not regulate the referral). The
      exceptions contain multiple enumerated requirements which must be met.
      Given the strict liability and severe consequences of noncompliance,
      physicians and entities should seek legal counsel to ensure that they are
      strictly complying with any exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently used exceptions for referrals include the physicians' services
      and in-office ancillary services exceptions.<sup
        ><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently used exceptions for financial relationships include, without
      limitation, the following: (1) ownership or investment interests in
      certain publicly traded investment securities and mutual funds;
      <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> (2) payments made for certain
      office space <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> and equipment
      rentals; <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> (3) payments made by
      an employer to an employee who has a true ("bona fide") employment
      arrangement with the employer
      <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> and payments made under
      certain personal service arrangements;
      <sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> (4) certain hospital
      physician recruitment incentives;
      <sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> (5) payments made in
      connection with isolated financial transactions, such as a one-time sale
      of property or practice; <sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> and
      (6) certain payments related to electronic prescribing or electronic
      health records items and services.<sup

        >Does compliance with the Stark laws ensure compliance with the
        Medicare-Medicaid anti-kickback law or Washington's anti-rebate law?

      No. See

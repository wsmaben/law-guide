<h1>Rebates</h1>
<p><strong>May a physician receive a payment for referring a patient to another physician?
</strong></p>
<p>
No. Under Washington law, it is both a misdemeanor <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and unprofessional conduct <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> for a physician to receive any rebate, refund, commission, unearned discount or profit or compensation for referring patients. The physician's license may even be revoked under such circumstances.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> See UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT.
</p>
<p><strong>What does Washington's anti-rebate law prohibit?
</strong></p>
<p>
Under Washington's anti-rebate statute, it is a misdemeanor for any person or entity to pay, offer to pay, allow, request, or receive, directly or indirectly, any rebate, refund, commission, unearned discount or profit by means of a credit or other valuable consideration from a third party (someone other than the patient) in connection with:<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The referral of patients.</li>
	<li>The furnishing of any medical, surgical or dental care diagnosis, treatment or service.</li>
	<li>The sale, rental, furnishing or supplying of:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Any clinical laboratory supplies or services of any kind.</li>
	<li>Drugs, medications or medical supplies.</li>
	<li>Any other goods, services or supplies prescribed for medical diagnosis, care or treatment.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
The statute does not prevent a patient from paying a physician for services rendered or prescriptions received, nor does it prevent a physician from making a profit on the furnishing of goods or care to a patient.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Are there any exceptions to Washington's anti-rebate prohibitions?</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Under Washington's anti-rebate law, a physician who has an ownership interest in an entity which furnishes clinical laboratory or other diagnostic services may refer a patient to that entity, if and only if:<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The physician affirmatively discloses to the patient, in writing, the fact that the physician has a financial interest in the entity.</li>
	<li>The physician provides the patient with a list of effective alternative facilities.</li>
	<li>The physician informs the patient that the patient has the option of using one of the alternative facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The physician assures the patient that the patient will not be treated differently if the patient chooses one of the alternative facilities.
</p>
<p>
Next, generally, Washington's anti-rebate law does not prohibit partners who are licensed professionals or a licensed professional who employs another licensee from profiting off the professional services of their partner or employee.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Finally, Washington's anti-rebate law also does not prohibit any activity by an entity (other than a clinical laboratory licensed or certified under federal or state law) when the activity is allowed or does not violate the federal anti-kickback statute.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Does compliance with the exception to Washington's anti-rebate prohibition ensure compliance with either the Medicare-Medicaid anti-kickback law or the Medicare-Medicaid physician self-referral prohibitions?
</strong></p>
<p>
No. See MEDICARE-MEDICAID FRAUD AND ABUSE AND ANTI-KICKBACK PROVISIONS and MEDICARE-MEDICAID PHYSICIAN SELF-REFERRAL PROHIBITIONS (STARK LAWS) for information concerning compliance with those laws.

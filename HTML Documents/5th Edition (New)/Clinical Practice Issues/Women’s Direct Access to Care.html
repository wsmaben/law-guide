        >Must health care carriers insure that female patients have direct
        access to timely and appropriate covered women's health care services
        from certain types of health care providers of their choice?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Health care carriers, policies, plans, and programs must provide
      women patients with direct access to certain types of health care
      providers of their choice for appropriate covered women's health care
      services without the necessity of prior referral from another type of
      health care provider.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Health care
      carriers, however, may restrict women patients to seeing only health care
      providers who have signed participating agreements with the health care
      carrier.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

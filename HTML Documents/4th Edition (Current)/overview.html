<p>
The Washington State Medical Association is proud to present the fourth edition of the Washington Physicians' Guide to Health Law in a completely digital, online format. The content of the legal guide has been completely updated since the third edition, which was compiled in February, 2007. The chapters have been reorganized according to broad general topics and specific subtopics (see menus to the left). Because the Washington Physicians' Guide to Health Law is now an online resource, the legal guide will be updated more regularly as the laws, regulations, or court cases which support the content change. In addition, we will add additional sections and chapters to the Washington Physicians' Guide to Health Law whenever indicated. We hope that you will find this legal guide to be a useful tool for your practice, and easy to use. We welcome your comments and suggestions.

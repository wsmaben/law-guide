<h1>Medicare - Medicaid Fraud and Abuse and Anti-kickback Provisions</h1>
<p>
NOTE: Analysis of issues related to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse, federal and state anti-kickback laws is generally quite complex and fact-specific. Most of the safe harbors related to the federal anti-kickback law contain multiple enumerated requirements which must be met in order to achieve safe harbor protection. Physicians are well-advised to seek legal advice on these matters.
</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes fraud under the Medicare-Medicaid laws?
</strong></p>
<p>
In general terms, for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid laws, "fraud" means an intentional deception or misrepresentation made for the purpose of obtaining payment or other benefit not otherwise due or made with the knowledge that the deception or misrepresentation could result in some unauthorized payment or benefit to oneself or to some other person.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Fraud, for purposes of Medicaid law, also includes any act that would constitute fraud under any applicable state or federal law. 
</p>
<p>
Health care fraud may take one of several forms, including among others:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Submission of false claims for payment of items or services which were not provided.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></li>
	<li>Submission of claims for payment for items or services more complicated (or more costly) than those which were actually provided.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> </li>
	<li>Kickback arrangements between service providers and their suppliers or referral sources.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> </li>
</ul>
<p>
With respect to fraudulently making false statements regarding a federal health care program, a person does not need to have actual knowledge of the wrongful act or have a specific intent to commit fraud.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes abuse under the Medicare-Medicaid laws?
</strong></p>
<p>
"Abuse," for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid laws, means those practices of providers, physicians, and other suppliers of health care items or services which are inconsistent with accepted sound medical, financial, or business practices, such that those practices result, directly or indirectly, in unnecessary costs to the Medicare or Medicaid programs.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Specifically, the standards CMS uses to determine abuse in in billing are whether the act was (i) reasonable and necessary, (ii) conformed to professionally recognized standards, and (iii) provided at a fair price.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Abuse can involve, among other things, claims for items or services which were not medically necessary or for which there is no legal entitlement to payment.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> However, to constitute abuse, unlike fraud, no intentional deception or misrepresentation is required.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes an illegal kickback under the Medicare and Medicaid programs?
</strong></p>
<p>
The federal anti-kickback statute (AKS)<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration in connection with referring an individual for medical items or services for which payment may be made by any "federal health care program," including Medicare and Medicaid. Thus, the AKS prohibits a physician from knowingly and willfully soliciting or receiving any kind of remuneration in any form in return for referring a patient for Medicare or Medicaid services. But a physician or other defendant does not have to have actual knowledge or a specific intent to commit a violation of the AKS <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>. Further, some courts have held that, even where there are legitimate purposes for a payment, if one purpose of a payment is to induce referrals then the AKS has been violated.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What are the penalties for violating the federal anti-kickback law?
</strong></p>
<p>
The penalties for violating the AKS are numerous and severe. A violation constitutes a felony punishable, upon conviction, by a fine of up to $100,000 and/or imprisonment for up to ten years.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> Violations may also result in the imposition of substantial civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> For example, any claim to the federal government that includes items or services "resulting from" a violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a "false or fraudulent claim" under the False Claims Act, thereby exposing anti-kickback statute violators to penalties for each claim (between $11,181 and $22,363) and treble damages.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> Under these provisions, the penalties quickly become extremely large. Other penalties and consequences may exist. 
</p>
<p><strong>What are "safe harbor" regulations?
</strong></p>
<p>
Because the language of the anti-kickback statute is so broad that it could encompass many harmless, yet beneficial and efficient, commercial arrangements, Congress directed DHHS to promulgate regulations specifying those payment practices which, although potentially capable of inducing referrals of business under Medicare or Medicaid, would not be considered kickbacks for purposes of criminal prosecution or imposition of civil penalties under the AKS.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
DHHS has responded to that directive by creating a number of safe harbors. Most of these safe harbors contain multiple enumerated requirements which must be met in order to achieve safe harbor protection. The enumerated requirements typically include, among other things, requirements that the amounts paid be determined in advance, consistent with fair market value and not be determined in a manner that takes into account, directly or directly, the volume or value of referrals.
</p>
<p>
If a remuneration arrangement fully complies with all of the enumerated requirements of a specific final safe harbor, the remuneration arrangement will not be subject to criminal prosecution or imposition of civil penalties under the AKS.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What happens if a remuneration arrangement does not fit entirely within a safe harbor?
</strong></p>
<p>
If a remuneration arrangement fails to fully comply with all of the enumerated requirements of a specific final safe harbor, there is no absolute protection from criminal or civil AKS enforcement actions.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> That does not mean, however, that all remuneration arrangements which do not fit squarely within the confines of a specific final safe harbor necessarily will be deemed criminal offenses or will be prosecuted under the AKS . It means simply that, where individuals and entities have entered into arrangements covered by the statute, but have failed to fully comply with an applicable final safe harbor or exception, they risk scrutiny and may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action. The degree of risk depends on an evaluation of many which are the basis of the decision-making process to select cases for investigation and prosecution.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What areas are covered by the safe harbors?
</strong></p>
<p>
DHHS has promulgated over twenty safe harbors. Frequently used safe harbors include renumeration related to investments, space rentals, equipment rentals, employment, personal services and management contracts, discounts, waiver of beneficiary copays and similar items, practitioner recruitment, investments in group practices, ambulatory surgical centers, and electronic prescribing and electronic health records items and services. Because most of the safe harbors contain multiple enumerated requirements which must be met in order to achieve safe harbor protection, physicians should seek legal advice before assuming that their remuneration arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback law.
</p>
<p><strong>Are there any "Fraud Alerts" which describe particular payment practices targeted by the agencies charged with the enforcement of the Medicare-Medicaid fraud and abuse and anti-kickback laws?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has published a number of "Fraud Alerts" concerning certain kinds of remuneration arrangements, not protected by existing final safe harbors, which may be violative of the AKS. The topics addressed by these Fraud Alerts are too numerous to list, but include:<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Joint venture arrangements.</li>
	<li>Routine waiver of co-payments or deductibles under Medicare.</li>
	<li>Financial arrangements between hospitals and hospital-based physicians.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup></li>
	<li>Hospital incentives to referring physicians.</li>
	<li>Prescription drug marketing schemes.</li>
	<li>Arrangements for provision of clinical laboratory services.</li>
	<li>Home health fraud.</li>
	<li>Medical supplies to nursing facilities.</li>
	<li>Provision of services in nursing facilities.</li>
	<li>Nursing home arrangement with hospice.</li>
	<li>Physician liability for certification in the provision of medical equipment and supplies and home health services.</li>
	<li>Rental of space in physician offices by persons or entities to whom the physicians refer.</li>
	<li>Telemarketing by durable medical equipment suppliers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where can a physician obtain copies of Fraud Alerts?
</strong></p>
<p>
Physicians can obtain copies of Fraud Alerts from the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201, telephone number 1 800 368 5779. Information related to fraud alerts may also be found at <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/alerts/index.asp">http://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/alerts/index.asp</a>.

</p>
<p><strong>Does Washington also have an anti-kickback law?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. See REBATES.
</p>
<p><strong>Does compliance with the federal anti-kickback law ensure compliance with Washington's anti-rebate law?
</strong></p>
<p>
No, not necessarily. See REBATES.
</p>
<p><strong>Are there any physician self-referral prohibitions under the Medicare-Medicaid laws?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. See MEDICARE-MEDICAID PHYSICIAN SELF-REFERRAL PROHIBITIONS (STARK LAWS).
</p>
<p><strong>Does compliance with the federal anti-kickback law ensure compliance with the Stark laws?
</strong></p>
<p>
No. The AKS and the Stark laws address different evils and contain different prohibitions and exceptions. Physicians need to examine their financial relationships with other health care providers and entities separately under each of these laws. Physicians are well-advised to seek legal advice concerning any financial relationships they have with referral sources.

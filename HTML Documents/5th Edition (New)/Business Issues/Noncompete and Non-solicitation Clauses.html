<h1>Noncompete and Non-solicitation Clauses</h1>
<p><strong>What is a noncompete or noncompetition clause?
</strong></p>
<p>
A noncompetition clause is a provision, typically found in an employment contract or a contract for sale of a practice, in which an employee or seller of a practice agrees not to compete with the employer or purchaser of a practice within a certain geographic area for a certain period of time following termination of the employment relationship or purchase of the practice.
</p>
<p><strong>Are noncompete clauses enforceable against physicians?
</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, yes.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Noncompete clauses are generally enforceable, as long as the duration, geographic area, and scope covered by the noncompete restriction are reasonable.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
A physician should carefully review any contract containing a noncompete clause before signing to ensure that the duration, and geographic area, and scope of the noncompete area restriction are acceptable.
</p>
<p><strong>What is a non-solicitation clause?
</strong></p>
<p>
A non-solicitation clause is a provision, typically found in an employment contract, or contract for sale of a practice, in which an employee or seller of a practice agrees not to solicit business from patients or referral sources of the employer or purchaser of the practice following termination of the employment relationship or purchase of the practice.
</p>
<p><strong>Are non-solicitation clauses enforceable?
</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, yes. Non-solicitation clauses are a type of covenant not to compete, and are therefore generally enforceable as long as they are reasonable.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Is the law around noncompetition and non-solicitation clauses changing in 2020? 
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Washington passed a new law that, starting January 1, 2020, substantially changes the noncompete law in Washington.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> The new law applies to both new and existing covenants (unless a lawsuit is started over the existing covenant prior to January 1, 2020). However, with respect to an existing covenant, the employee can only bring a claim if the employer is "enforcing" the covenant. Enforcing is not defined, but it probably means something in between doing nothing and suing the employee (i.e., communicating an expectation of compliance, demanding compliance, etc.). 
</p>
<p>
The new law only applies to noncompetition covenants, which does not include (a) a nonsolicitation agreement (narrowly defined); (b) a confidentiality agreement; (c) a covenant prohibiting use or disclosure of trade secrets or inventions; (d) a covenant entered into by a person purchasing or selling the goodwill of a business or otherwise acquiring or disposing of an ownership interest; or (e) certain covenants entered into by a franchisee.
</p>
<p>
The new law prohibits noncompetition covenants unless the party seeking enforcement paid the employee more than $100,000 in the previous year (annualized for partial years) as reported in box 1 of the W-2 (which box 1 excludes retirement contributions). The $100,000 threshold will get adjusted every year for inflation. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, for employees above this threshold, the new law still imposes requirements regarding noncompetition covenants, which generally include the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disclosure: The employer must disclose the terms of covenant in writing no later than the time of the acceptance of the offer of employment</li>
	<li>Layoffs: If an employee is laid off, enforcement of the covenant must include compensation payable to the laid off employee during the time of enforcement. The compensation is the employee's base salary offset by other earnings. The law does not define layoff.</li>
	<li>Duration: A duration of more than 18 months is presumed void and unreasonable, which presumption the employer can rebut with clear and convincing evidence.</li>
	<li>Consideration: The covenant has to be supported by consideration. For a new employee, this is the initial hiring (assuming the employee signs the noncompete before the first day of work). For an existing employee, the new condition might be a bonus, promotion, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In a major change, if a court modifies a noncompetition covenant in any way (i.e., reduces a 25 mile radius to 20 miles, or anything), the employer has to pay the employee's damages (with a minimum amount of $5,000) plus the employee's attorney fees, costs, and expenses. The enforceability of noncompete in the health care setting is very unpredictable, which creates a risk for the parties. For example, in the Emerick v. Cardiac Study Center, Inc., P.S., 189 Wn. App. 711 (2015), the court found that a non-compete for a cardiologist covering Pierce County/Federal Way was unreasonably and so the court reduced it down to a 2 mile radius around each clinic, allowed the cardiologist to work in any hospital, and added other exceptions. In that case, the employee still had to pay the employer's attorney fees (which amounted to more than $200,000). Under the new law, the employer would have had to pay the employee's fees.

<p>
The law also applies to independent contractors (very narrowly defined), but in different ways that are beyond the scope of this article.

      Medicare - Medicaid Fraud and Abuse and Anti-kickback Provisions
    </h1>
    <p>
      NOTE: Analysis of issues related to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse,
      federal and state anti-kickback laws is generally quite complex and
      fact-specific. Most of the safe harbors related to the federal
      anti-kickback law contain multiple enumerated requirements which must be
      met in order to achieve safe harbor protection. Physicians are
      well-advised to seek legal advice on these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What constitutes fraud under the Medicare-Medicaid laws? </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In general terms, for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid laws, "fraud"
      means an intentional deception or misrepresentation made for the purpose
      of obtaining payment or other benefit not otherwise due or made with the
      knowledge that the deception or misrepresentation could result in some
      unauthorized payment or benefit to oneself or to some other person.<sup
        ><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup
      >
      Fraud, for purposes of Medicaid law, also includes any act that would
      constitute fraud under any applicable state or federal law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health care fraud may take one of several forms, including among others:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Submission of false claims for payment of items or services which were
        not provided.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Submission of claims for payment for items or services more complicated
        (or more costly) than those which were actually provided.<sup
          ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Kickback arrangements between service providers and their suppliers or
        referral sources.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With respect to fraudulently making false statements regarding a federal
      health care program, a person does not need to have actual knowledge of
      the wrongful act or have a specific intent to commit fraud.<sup
        ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What constitutes abuse under the Medicare-Medicaid laws? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abuse," for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid laws, means those practices
      of providers, physicians, and other suppliers of health care items or
      services which are inconsistent with accepted sound medical, financial, or
      business practices, such that those practices result, directly or
      indirectly, in unnecessary costs to the Medicare or Medicaid programs.<sup
        ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
      >
      Specifically, the standards CMS uses to determine abuse in in billing are
      whether the act was (i) reasonable and necessary, (ii) conformed to
      professionally recognized standards, and (iii) provided at a fair
      price.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Abuse can involve, among
      other things, claims for items or services which were not medically
      necessary or for which there is no legal entitlement to payment.<sup
        ><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup
      >
      However, to constitute abuse, unlike fraud, no intentional deception or
      misrepresentation is required.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What constitutes an illegal kickback under the Medicare and Medicaid
        programs?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The federal anti-kickback statute (AKS)<sup
        ><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup
      >
      makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or
      receive any remuneration in connection with referring an individual for
      medical items or services for which payment may be made by any "federal
      health care program," including Medicare and Medicaid. Thus, the AKS
      prohibits a physician from knowingly and willfully soliciting or receiving
      any kind of remuneration in any form in return for referring a patient for
      Medicare or Medicaid services. But a physician or other defendant does not
      have to have actual knowledge or a specific intent to commit a violation
      of the AKS <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup
      >. Further, some courts have held that, even where there are legitimate
      purposes for a payment, if one purpose of a payment is to induce referrals
      then the AKS has been violated.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What are the penalties for violating the federal anti-kickback law?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The penalties for violating the AKS are numerous and severe. A violation
      constitutes a felony punishable, upon conviction, by a fine of up to
      $100,000 and/or imprisonment for up to ten years.<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
      Violations may also result in the imposition of substantial civil money
      penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
      programs.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> For example, any
      claim to the federal government that includes items or services "resulting
      from" a violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a "false or
      fraudulent claim" under the False Claims Act, thereby exposing
      anti-kickback statute violators to penalties for each claim (between
      $11,181 and $22,363) and treble damages.<sup
        ><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup
      >
      Under these provisions, the penalties quickly become extremely large.
      Other penalties and consequences may exist.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What are "safe harbor" regulations? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Because the language of the anti-kickback statute is so broad that it
      could encompass many harmless, yet beneficial and efficient, commercial
      arrangements, Congress directed DHHS to promulgate regulations specifying
      those payment practices which, although potentially capable of inducing
      referrals of business under Medicare or Medicaid, would not be considered
      kickbacks for purposes of criminal prosecution or imposition of civil
      penalties under the AKS.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      DHHS has responded to that directive by creating a number of safe harbors.
      Most of these safe harbors contain multiple enumerated requirements which
      must be met in order to achieve safe harbor protection. The enumerated
      requirements typically include, among other things, requirements that the
      amounts paid be determined in advance, consistent with fair market value
      and not be determined in a manner that takes into account, directly or
      directly, the volume or value of referrals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a remuneration arrangement fully complies with all of the enumerated
      requirements of a specific final safe harbor, the remuneration arrangement
      will not be subject to criminal prosecution or imposition of civil
      penalties under the AKS.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What happens if a remuneration arrangement does not fit entirely within
        a safe harbor?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a remuneration arrangement fails to fully comply with all of the
      enumerated requirements of a specific final safe harbor, there is no
      absolute protection from criminal or civil AKS enforcement actions.<sup
        ><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup
      >
      That does not mean, however, that all remuneration arrangements which do
      not fit squarely within the confines of a specific final safe harbor
      necessarily will be deemed criminal offenses or will be prosecuted under
      the AKS . It means simply that, where individuals and entities have
      entered into arrangements covered by the statute, but have failed to fully
      comply with an applicable final safe harbor or exception, they risk
      scrutiny and may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action. The
      degree of risk depends on an evaluation of many which are the basis of the
      decision-making process to select cases for investigation and
      prosecution.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>What areas are covered by the safe harbors? </strong></p>
    <p>
      DHHS has promulgated over twenty safe harbors. Frequently used safe
      harbors include renumeration related to investments, space rentals,
      equipment rentals, employment, personal services and management contracts,
      discounts, waiver of beneficiary copays and similar items, practitioner
      recruitment, investments in group practices, ambulatory surgical centers,
      and electronic prescribing and electronic health records items and
      services. Because most of the safe harbors contain multiple enumerated
      requirements which must be met in order to achieve safe harbor protection,
      physicians should seek legal advice before assuming that their
      remuneration arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there any "Fraud Alerts" which describe particular payment
        practices targeted by the agencies charged with the enforcement of the
        Medicare-Medicaid fraud and abuse and anti-kickback laws?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has published a number of
      "Fraud Alerts" concerning certain kinds of remuneration arrangements, not
      protected by existing final safe harbors, which may be violative of the
      AKS. The topics addressed by these Fraud Alerts are too numerous to list,
      but include:<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Joint venture arrangements.</li>
      <li>Routine waiver of co-payments or deductibles under Medicare.</li>
      <li>
        Financial arrangements between hospitals and hospital-based
        physicians.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>Hospital incentives to referring physicians.</li>
      <li>Prescription drug marketing schemes.</li>
      <li>Arrangements for provision of clinical laboratory services.</li>
      <li>Home health fraud.</li>
      <li>Medical supplies to nursing facilities.</li>
      <li>Provision of services in nursing facilities.</li>
      <li>Nursing home arrangement with hospice.</li>
      <li>
        Physician liability for certification in the provision of medical
        equipment and supplies and home health services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rental of space in physician offices by persons or entities to whom the
        physicians refer.
      </li>
      <li>Telemarketing by durable medical equipment suppliers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Where can a physician obtain copies of Fraud Alerts? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Physicians can obtain copies of Fraud Alerts from the Office of the
      Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services, 200
      Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201, telephone number 1 800
      368 5779. Information related to fraud alerts may also be found at

    <p>
      <strong

      No, not necessarily. See

      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. The AKS and the Stark laws address different evils and contain
      different prohibitions and exceptions. Physicians need to examine their
      financial relationships with other health care providers and entities
      separately under each of these laws. Physicians are well-advised to seek
      legal advice concerning any financial relationships they have with
      referral sources.

    <h3>Must a physician report cases of animal bites?</h3>
    <p>While not all animal bites require reporting, those bites in which human exposure to rabies is suspected is reportable to the local health department. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Principal health care providers should notify the local health department of animal bites immediately at the time of diagnosis or suspected diagnosis, by telephone or by secure facsimile transmission of a written case report. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> If the latter method of communication is used, the party sending the report must confirm immediate receipt by a live person. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> See NOTIFIABLE CONDITIONS.</p>
    <h3>What must a physician include in a report of a case of animal bite?</h3>

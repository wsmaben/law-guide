<h1>Medicare - Medicaid Report And Return Obligation</h1>
<p>
NOTE: The law around reporting and returning overpayments changes regularly and decisions in this area are complex, fact-specific, and can have criminal consequences. Everyone is well-advised to seek legal advice at the first sign of potential overpayments. <!-- The Legal Resource Center of the Washington State Medical Association (www.wsma.org) can assist you in identifying attorneys experienced such questions. -->
</p>
<p><strong>Is there an obligation to report and return overpayments received from federal health care programs?
</strong></p>
<p>
The Affordable Care Act imposes an express obligation to report and return overpayments received from federal health care programs (including Medicare-Medicaid) within 60 days of identification. This is commonly referred to as the "60-Day Rule."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
An "overpayment" means "any funds that a person receives or retains under [Medicare or Medicaid] to which the person, after applicable reconciliation, is not entitled."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> CMS has promulgated regulations interpreting the 60-Day Rule for Medicare Part A and B <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> as well as Medicare Parts C and D <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> payments. As of November 2019, CMS has not published regulations for Medicaid and the regulations under Part C are subject to an ongoing case that has questioned their validity. <em>See UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co. v. Azar</em>, 330 F. Supp. 3d 173 (D.D.C. 2018).
</p>
<p><strong>What are the consequences of failing to timely report and return overpayments?
</strong></p>
<p>
Failure to report and return the overpayment within 60 days of identification creates an "obligation" under the False Claims Act (FCA), which then triggers the "reverse false claims" provision of the FCA for knowing concealment or avoidance of "an obligation to pay" money to the government. Penalties for violating the FCA are severe and include per claim civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363, adjusted for inflation, as well as treble damages suffered by the government.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> These civil penalties can result in huge liabilities. 
</p>
<p><strong>When is an overpayment identified? 
</strong></p>
<p>
An overpayment is deemed identified when a person "has, or should have through the exercise of reasonable diligence, determined that the person has received an overpayment." <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> The phrase "reasonable diligence" includes both proactive, good faith compliance measures to monitor receipt of overpayments as well as reactive and timely good faith investigation in response to "credible information" of potential overpayments. Further, the "reasonable diligence" standard requires a provider "to inquire further to determine whether there are more overpayments on the same issue before reporting and returning the single overpaid claim."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
An overpayment is not "identified" until it is quantified.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Statistical sampling, extrapolation methodologies and other methodologies may be used to determine the amount of the overpayment. A provider has an obligation to conduct a reasonable inquiry to determine whether, in fact, an overpayment occurred when the provider becomes aware of "credible information" that suggests an overpayment may have occurred. Normally, reasonable diligence can be shown through "a timely, good faith investigation of credible information," which is at most six months from receipt of credible information giving rise to the investigation.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Extraordinary cases may justify a time frame in excess of six months.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Is there a limit on how far back a provider must report and return overpayments? 
</strong></p>
<p>
A provider is responsible for reporting and returning any overpayments that have been received within six years of the date it was identified.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>

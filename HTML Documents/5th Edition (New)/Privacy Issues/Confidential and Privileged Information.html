<h1>Confidential and Privileged Information</h1>

<p><strong> What is the physician-patient privilege?
</strong></p>

<p>
	The physician-patient privilege protects the patient in a civil action from the physician's disclosure&mdash;without the patient's consent&mdash;of any information that the physician acquires in the course of attending the patient that was necessary to enable the physician to prescribe or act for the patient. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Privileged information is not limited to communications between the physician and the patient, but also covers all information acquired by the physician in the course of attending the patient, including tests conducted, x rays, prescriptions, and statements in hospital charts or other records. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p><strong>Are there exceptions to the physician-patient privilege?
</strong></p>

<p>
	Yes. The physician-patient privilege has several specific exceptions, including the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>There is no privilege in any judicial proceeding regarding a child's injury, neglect, sexual abuse, or their respective causes. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></li>

	<li>When a patient files an action for wrongful death or personal injury, the patient is deemed to have waived the privilege 90 days after filing. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> But see DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH CARE INFORMATION concerning when a physician may disclose a patient's health care information in litigation.</li>

	<li>The privilege does not apply when a patient has an active workers' compensation claim and a treating physician is asked to testify concerning, or to provide information relevant to, the worker's occupational injury or illness. <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> See WORKERS' COMPENSATION.</li>

	<li>Information communicated to a physician in an effort to unlawfully procure a controlled substance or to procure the administration of a controlled substance is deemed not to be a privileged communication. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></li>

	<li>The privilege may be waived, in the court's discretion, in proceedings for chemical dependency <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> or mental illness,<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> and in proceedings relating to the administration of anti-psychotic medications. <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> The waiver, however, is limited to records or testimony relevant to evaluation of the detained person for purposes of the proceeding. <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></li>

	<li>Neither the victim nor the alleged perpetrator of a crime can assert the privilege to prevent the State from offering evidence of the victim's injuries or other evidence of the crime. <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></li>

	<li>The privilege does not prevent a court-appointed investigator from obtaining a child's medical information in a custody dispute, but the child's permission is generally required if the child is age 12 or older. <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who is bound by the physician-patient privilege?
</strong></p>

<p>
	The physician and any agents or employees of the physician who have access to the patient's health care information are bound by the privilege. <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>
</p>

<p><strong>When does the physician patient privilege arise?
</strong></p>

<p>
	In general, the physician patient privilege arises when a person consults a physician for treatment or medical advice. Whether a physician-patient relationship is created depends on whether the patient believes that the patient's contact with the physician was for the purposes of treatment. <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Therefore, each situation is highly dependent on the facts. See PHYSICIAN-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP.
</p>

<p><strong>Who may waive the physician patient privilege?
</strong></p>

<p>
	The privilege belongs to the patient and, except where the privilege is waived by law, only the patient or the patient's legal representative may waive the privilege. <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>
</p>

<p><strong>Does the physician patient privilege terminate upon the patient's death?
</strong></p>

<p>
	No. Except where the privilege is waived by law, only the personal representative or an heir of the patient's estate may waive the privilege after the patient's death. <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>
</p>

<p><strong>When may medical records or privileged health care information be disclosed?
</strong></p>

<p>
	See DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH CARE INFORMATION.
</p>

<p><strong>May medical records and privileged health care information be released in response to a subpoena?
</strong></p>

<p>
	Under certain circumstances, yes. See DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH CARE INFORMATION; and <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Subpoenas.aspx">SUBPOENAS</a>.

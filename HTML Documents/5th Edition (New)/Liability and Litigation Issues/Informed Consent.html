<h1>Informed Consent</h1>
<p><strong>What is informed consent?
</strong></p>
<p>
Informed consent is consent to treatment given by a patient or a patient's legal representative, after being fully informed in language the patient or patient's legal representative can reasonably be expected to understand, of all material facts relating to the treatment, including:<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The nature and character of the treatment proposed and administered.</li>
	<li>The anticipated results of the treatment proposed and administered.</li>
	<li>The recognized possible alternative forms of treatment.</li>
	<li>The recognized serious possible risks, complications, and anticipated benefits involved in the treatment proposed and the recognized possible alternative forms of treatment, including non-treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When is informed consent required?
</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, except in certain emergency cases <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> or when the patient requests not to be fully informed,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> informed consent is required before any treatment may be rendered to a patient.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> A physician's failure to obtain informed consent prior to treatment may subject the physician to liability in a medical malpractice action for any injuries caused by treatment to which the patient or the patient's legal representative did not consent.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Special informed consent is required in some instances. See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/AIDS-HIV-STD.aspx">AIDS/HIV/STD</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Who may give consent to treatment?</strong></p>
<p>
An otherwise competent adult patient may give informed consent to treatment.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
If a patient is not competent to give informed consent, informed consent may be obtained from one of the following persons in order of priority:<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The appointed guardian of the patient, if any.</li>
	<li>A person to whom the patient has given a durable power of attorney encompassing the authority to make health care decisions.</li>
	<li>The patient's spouse or state registered domestic partner.</li>
	<li>Children of the patient who are age 18 or older.</li>
	<li>Parents of the patient.</li>
	<li>Adult siblings of the patient.</li>
	<li>Adult grandchildren of the patient who are familiar with the patient.</li>
	<li>Adult nieces and nephews of the patient who are familiar with the patient.</li>
	<li>Adult aunts and uncles of the patient who are familiar with the patient.</li>
	<li>Another adult as further described in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the physician seeking informed consent for an incompetent patient makes reasonable efforts to locate and secure authorization from a competent person in the first or succeeding class of priority and finds no such person available, authorization may be given by any person in the next class in the order of descending priority.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> No person may provide informed consent if a person in a higher class of priority has refused to give such authorization.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> If there are two or more persons in the same class of priority, the decision must be unanimous among all available members of that class.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
If the physician seeking informed consent for an incompetent patient makes reasonable efforts to locate and secure authorization from a competent person in the first or succeeding class of priority and finds no such person available, authorization may be given by any person in the next class in the order of descending priority.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> No person may provide informed consent if a person in a higher class of priority has refused to give such authorization.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> If there are two or more persons in the same class of priority, the decision must be unanimous among all available members of that class.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
An individual above authorized to provide informed consent may not, under such authority, exercise rights for the incompetent patient under Washington's death with dignity act.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What are the requirements for another adult to provide informed consent? 
</strong></p>
<p>
Subject to the requirements above, another adult may provide informed consent if such adult is an individual who (a) has exhibited special care and concern for the patient, (b) is familiar with the patient's personal values, (c) is reasonably available to make health care decisions, (d) is not (i) a physician to the patient or an employee of the physician; (ii) the owner, administrator, or employee of a health care facility, nursing home, or long-term care facility where the patient resides or receives care; or (iii) a person who receives compensation to provide care to the patient; and (d) provides a declaration signed and dated within the last six months under penalty of perjury that recites facts and circumstances demonstrating that he or she is familiar with the patient and that he or she: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Meets the requirements of items (a) through (d) above; </li>
	<li>Is a close friend of the patient;</li>
	<li>Is willing and able to become involved in the patient's health care;</li>
	<li>Has maintained such regular contact with the patient as to be familiar with the patient's activities, health, personal values, and morals; and</li>
	<li>Is not aware of a person in a higher priority class willing and able to provide informed consent to health care on behalf of the patient.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A health care provider may, but is not required to, rely on such a declaration. The health care provider or health care facility where services are rendered is immune from suit in any action, civil or criminal, or from professional or other disciplinary action when such reliance is based on a compliant declaration.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Are there special rules for homeless youth?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. A minor is competent to provide informed consent in certain specific situations. Parental authorization or authorization from a person who may consent on behalf of the minor is required if the minor is under the age of thirteen.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Beginning_Of_Life_And_Childhood_Issues/Minors_Treatment_of.aspx">MINORS, TREATMENT OF</a> for when minors can provide informed consent.
</p>
<p><strong>Is a minor competent to give informed consent?
</strong></p>
<p>
A minor is competent to provide informed consent in certain specific situations. Parental authorization or authorization from a person who may consent on behalf of the minor is required if the minor is under the age of thirteen.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Beginning_Of_Life_And_Childhood_Issues/Minors_Treatment_of.aspx">MINORS, TREATMENT OF</a> for when minors can provide informed consent.
</p>
<p><strong>Who may provide informed consent on behalf of minors who are not authorized to provide consent on their own behalf?
</strong></p>
<p>
If a minor is not otherwise authorized to provide informed consent for health care, including mental health care, such consent may be obtained from one of the following persons in order of priority:<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The appointed guardian, or legal custodian of the minor patient, if any.</li>
	<li>A person authorized by the court to consent for medical care for a child in an out-of-home placement.</li>
	<li>Parents of the minor child.</li>
	<li>A person to whom the parents have given a signed authorization to make health care decisions.</li>
	<li>A competent adult representing himself or herself to be a relative responsible for the healthcare of the child, provided that the person sign a sworn statement to that effect.</li>
	<li>a school nurse, school counselor, or homeless student liaison with respect only limited outpatient services for a "homeless child or youth" not under the supervision or control of a parent, custodian, or legal guardian and is not in the care and custody of the department of social and health services, and, </li>
</ul>
<p>
A physician may rely on the representation of a person who claims to be responsible for the healthcare decisions of a child, but is not required to do so.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> A physician who renders care to a minor, relying on consent obtained from a person who has signed such a sworn declaration is protected from legal action related to the consent.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Must informed consent be obtained in an emergency?
</strong></p>
<p>
Not necessarily. Consent of the patient will usually be implied if an emergency situation exists requiring prompt treatment to avoid the possibility of injury or death and if the patient is unable to consent for any reason and no other person legally authorized to provide consent is reasonably available.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>How should informed consent be documented?
</strong></p>
<p>
Signed consent forms may be used, but not in lieu of, or as a substitute for, a discussion with the patient.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> Signed consent forms should be kept in the patient's chart. 
</p>
<p>
If the patient requests not to be informed or to receive only limited information, the patient's request should be put in writing, signed by the patient, and placed in the patient's chart.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Discussions with the patient about risks, benefits and alternatives should be documented with specificity in the patient's chart. The absence of specific contemporaneous documentation of informed consent discussions in medical malpractice actions alleging failure to obtain informed consent brought on behalf of patients who have died or become incompetent may prove difficult to defend. In such cases, absent such documentation, the physician may be barred by the deadman's statute from presenting evidence as to the details of what the physician told the patient, <sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> or as to the physician's habit and routine in informing similarly situated patients, about risks, benefits, and alternatives to the treatment proposed and administered.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Must informed consent be given to involuntarily committed patients?
</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, yes. But see <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Involuntary_Commitment_Substance_Use_Disorder.aspx">INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT – SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER</a> and <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Involuntary_Commitment_Mental_Disorders.aspx">INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT &ndash; MENTAL DISORDERS</a> for circumstances where informed consent is not required. Informed consent may be contained in a validly executed mental health advance directive.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Should a physician ever promise a patient a particular result from treatment or a cure?
</strong></p>
<p>
No. Generally, the law presumes that a physician does not guarantee a particular result or cure. If, however, the physician promises the patient or the patient's legal representative that a particular injury will not occur, the physician may be liable for medical malpractice if the injury does occur.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>

    <h1>Abortion</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>When may an abortion be performed?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Washington law, every woman has the fundamental right to choose
      <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> or refuse to have an
      abortion.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      An abortion may only be performed prior to the viability of the fetus or
      to protect the woman's life or health.<sup
        ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup
      >
      "Viability" means the point in the pregnancy when there is a reasonable
      likelihood that the fetus would survive outside the uterus without the
      application of extraordinary medical measures.<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The good faith judgment of a physician as to the viability of the fetus,
      as to the risk to the life or health of the woman, or as to the duration
      of a pregnancy, is a defense in any proceeding against the physician in
      which violation of Washington's abortion law is in issue.<sup
        ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Who may perform an abortion?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a physician <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> may perform an
      abortion, but any health care provider may assist the physician. For
      anyone else to do so or for a doctor to do so contrary to the provisions
      of the law is a felony, punishable by up to five years in jail
      <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May a physician refuse to participate in the performance of an
        abortion?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup
      >. No person, including a physician, can be required to participate in the
      performance of an abortion. State law gives health providers the right to
      refuse <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> to perform abortions on
      moral and ethical grounds. No person may be discriminated against in
      employment or professional privilege for participating or refusing to
      participate in performing an abortion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there waiting periods before an abortion may be performed?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      No <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup
      >. There are no set waiting periods in Washington law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Must care be given to an infant born alive?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup
      >. A physician must treat an infant born alive in the course of an
      abortion procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>May an abortion be performed on a minor?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. An abortion may be performed on a pregnant woman under the age of 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Is parental notification or parental consent required for an abortion
        on a minor?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, no. Washington law does not specifically impose a requirement
      of parental notification or parental consent before an abortion may be
      performed on a competent or emancipated minor. A Washington statute which
      conditioned the right of an unmarried minor to obtain an abortion on
      parental consent was held unconstitutional
      <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >. Before performing an abortion on a minor without parental notification
      or parental consent, however, care should be taken to assure that the
      minor is competent to provide meaningful and informed consent. Among the
      factors to be considered in determining a minor's competence are the
      minor's age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic
      independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult, and freedom
      from parental control.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May an abortion be performed on a minor against the minor's
        will?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, no.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> An abortion
      cannot be performed on a minor against the minor's will unless it is
      pursuant to a court order to preserve the life or health of the minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May a husband or spouse prevent a woman from receiving an
        abortion?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      No <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup
      >. A husband cannot prevent a wife from having an abortion in Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Are there any reporting requirements for abortions?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup
      >. Each hospital and facility where lawfully induced abortions are
      performed must complete a report form each month for the Department of
      Health which specifies the number and dates of abortions performed during
      the previous month. For each such abortion, the following information must
      also be reported:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The age of the patient.</li>
      <li>The geographic location of the patient's residence.</li>
      <li>The patient's previous pregnancy history.</li>
      <li>The duration of the pregnancy.</li>
      <li>The method of abortion.</li>
      <li>
        Any complications, such as perforations, infections, and incomplete
        evacuations.
      </li>
      <li>
        The name of physician(s) performing or participating in the abortion.
      </li>
      <li>Such other information as may be required by the department.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A physician who performs an abortion in a nonapproved facility based on a
      determination that an abortion was immediately necessary to meet a medical
      emergency must report the information listed above and must also provide a
      clear and detailed statement of the facts which led to the conclusion that
      a medical emergency existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Does the state provide benefits
        <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> for abortion?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup
      >. If the state provides maternity care benefits, services or information
      to women through any program funded to some degree by the state, then the
      state will provide equivalent benefits, information or services related to
      voluntary termination of pregnancy to those women that would have
      otherwise been eligible for the maternity care programs.

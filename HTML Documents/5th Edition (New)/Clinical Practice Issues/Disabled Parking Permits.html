<h1>Disabled Parking Permits</h1>
<p><strong>Why is my patient asking me for a prescription when applying for disabled parking privileges?
</strong></p>
<p>
As of July 1, 2015, individuals will need a prescription to apply for Washington's special parking program for persons with disabilities. This means applicants will first need to get a licensed physician, physician assistant, or registered nurse practitioner to determine if the applicant can qualify for disabled parking privileges.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What if I don't have access to a prescription pad?
</strong></p>
<p>
Providers who do not have access to a prescription pad, or who do not have prescriptive authority, may issues an authorization on their office's official letterhead or by electronic means for the patient to use during the application process.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What are the potential penalties to me as a physician/physician assistant related to assisting a patient with a disabled parking permit?
</strong></p>
<p>
A health care practitioner who knowingly provides false information on the patient's application is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. The penalty is up to 364 days in jail and a fine of up to $5,000 or both. In addition, the health care practitioner may be subject to sanctions under chapter 18.130 RCW, the Uniform Disciplinary Act.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

    <p>
      <strong>Does Washington law permit the medical use of cannabis?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. In November 1998, the people of the State of Washington passed
      Initiative 692, allowing some patients with certain terminal or
      debilitating conditions, under the care of their physician, to produce,
      possess, and use a limited amount of cannabis for medical purposes. In
      2011, the legislature changed the requirements for providing medical
      cannabis recommendations to qualifying patients by passing ESSB 5073.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is still against federal law, however, to distribute or manufacture
      cannabis, or to possess it with intent to distribute or manufacture.<sup
        ><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup
      >
      There is no medical necessity exception to those federal law prohibitions.
      Cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has
      no generally recognized medical use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Health has developed a list of Frequently Asked
      Questions about requirements and practice standards when recommending
      medical cannabis.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Now that recreational use of marijuana is legal under Washington law,
        why would a patient seek permission for the medical use of cannabis?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A patient authorized to use medical cannabis obtains several benefits over
      recreational users:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Recreational users must pay a 37 percent sales tax on cannabis
        items,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> while medical users do
        not pay this tax.
      </li>
      <li>
        Medical patients can purchase three times the amount of cannabis flower
        and associated products than recreational users. For flower, it is three
        ounces versus one ounce.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Medical patients can grow six plants for their personal use (or up to
        fifteen plants with a doctor's permission) while general adult users are
        forbidden from growing their own.<sup
          ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Who can recommend the use of medical cannabis? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The following health care providers may recommend medical cannabis:<sup
        ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Medical doctors (MDs)</li>
      <li>Physician assistants (PAs)</li>
      <li>Osteopathic physicians (DOs)</li>
      <li>Osteopathic physician assistants (OPAs)</li>
      <li>Naturopathic physicians (NDs)</li>
      <li>Advanced registered nurse practitioners (ARNPs)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What patients qualify for medical use of cannabis? </strong></p>
    To qualify for medical use of cannabis, a patient:<sup
      ><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup
    >
    <ul>
      <li>
        Must be under the care of a health care professional licensed in
        Washington State.
      </li>
      <li>
        Must be diagnosed by that physician as having one of the following
        terminal or debilitating conditions:<sup
          ><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup

            medications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Glaucoma, either acute or chronic, limited for the purposes of the

        benefits of the medical use of cannabis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Must have been advised by the health care professional that he or she
        might benefit from the medical use of cannabis.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that a healthcare provider cannot have a business or practice which
      consists solely of authorizing the medical use of cannabis or include any
      statement or reference on the medical use of cannabis in advertisements.
      The law also restricts a healthcare provider from benefiting in certain
      ways for recommending medical cannabis.

        >Who is a "designated provider" under Washington law, and what may a
        "designated provider" do?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Designated providers must be 18 years of age or older, have been
      designated in writing by a patient to service as the designated provider,
      are prohibited from consuming cannabis obtained for the personal medical
      use of the patient, and is the designated provider to only one patient at
      any one time.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> The designated

        >What risks are there to recommending medical cannabis to a qualifying
        patient?

    </p>
    <p>
      State law establishes provider immunity against prosecution when
      appropriately recommending medical use of cannabis,<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
      but not federal law. Failure to adhere to state law requirements exposes
      the healthcare provider to risk of prosecution under state law and may
      also result in disciplinary action by the licensing authority.<sup

      Healthcare providers might also incur other penalties from privileging

      <strong

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How much cannabis may a qualifying patient possess? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The law is not very specific;
      <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> it only states that a
      qualifying patient or designated provider may possess no more than fifteen
      (15) cannabis plants and (i) no more than twenty four(24) ounces of
      useable cannabis; or (ii) no more cannabis product than what could
      reasonably be produced with no more than twenty four (24) ounces of
      useable cannabis; or a combination of useable cannabis and cannabis
      product that does not exceed a combined total of twenty four (24) ounces
      of useable cannabis. If an individual is both a qualifying patient and a
      designated provider for another qualifying patient, the individual can
      possess no more than twice the amounts described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What does the medical cannabis law allow a physician to do?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical cannabis law exempts physicians from state criminal laws, and
      protects physicians from being penalized or denied any right or privilege
      under state law, for: <sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Advising a qualifying patient about the risks and benefits of medical
        use of cannabis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advising a qualifying patient that he or she may benefit from the
        medical use of cannabis where such advice and use is within a
        professional standard of care or appropriate in the individual
        physician's medical judgment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing a qualifying patient with valid documentation, based upon the
        physician's assessment of the qualifying patient's medical history and
        current medical condition, that the potential benefits of the medical
        use of cannabis would likely outweigh the health risks for the
        particular qualifying patient.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Under the medical cannabis law, may physicians prescribe cannabis?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Physicians or the other authorized licensed health care professionals must
      not prescribe cannabis. It is prohibited under federal law to knowingly or
      intentionally distribute, dispense or possess cannabis.<sup
        ><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup
      >
      The terms "distribute" and "dispense" have been broadly interpreted, and
      physicians and the other authorized licensed health care professionals may
      be found in violation of federal law for writing a prescription for a
      substance, such as cannabis, for which federal law has no recognized
      medical use.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> Violation of
      federal laws can bring significant penalties, including imprisonment and
      fines.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> In addition, violating
      federal law (or aid and abet in its violation) may result in other federal
      sanctions, such as a revocation of a health care provider's DEA
      registration.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Must a physician authorize the use of medical cannabis? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, nothing in the medical cannabis law requires any physician to
      authorize the use of medical cannabis for a patient.

        qualifying patient, what documentation should the physician give the
        patient?

    </p>
    <p>
      Under the medical cannabis law, valid documentation is a statement signed
      by the qualifying patient's physician, or a copy of the patient's
      pertinent medical records, that states that, in the physician's
      professional opinion, the potential benefits of the medical use of
      cannabis would likely outweigh the health risks for the patient.<sup

      <strong
        >How should a physician prepare a recommendation for medical cannabis?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Recommendations must include information required in the law and must be
      written on tamper-proof paper.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>
      The paper must meet one or more of the following industry-recognized
      features:<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>

      <li>
        One or more features designed to prevent the use of counterfeit valid
        documentation.

      No. A physician who recommends the use of medical cannabis to qualifying
      patients may not have an ownership interest in a medical cannabis
      enterprise.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Program Act, which
      established the Washington State Controlled Substances Therapeutic
      Research Program, administered by the Department of Health.<sup

        >Is participation in the Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research
        Program limited?

    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Participation in the program is generally limited to cancer
      chemotherapy and radiology patients and glaucoma patients who are
      certified by a physician as being involved in a life-threatening or
      sense-threatening situation.<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>
      No patient may be admitted to the Controlled Substances Therapeutic
      Research Program without full disclosure by the physician of the

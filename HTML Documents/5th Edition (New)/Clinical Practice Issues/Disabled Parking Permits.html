        >Why is my patient asking me for a prescription when applying for
        disabled parking privileges?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      As of July 1, 2015, individuals will need a prescription to apply for
      Washington's special parking program for persons with disabilities. This
      means applicants will first need to get a licensed physician, physician
      assistant, or registered nurse practitioner to determine if the applicant
      can qualify for disabled parking privileges.<sup
        ><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>What if I don't have access to a prescription pad? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Providers who do not have access to a prescription pad, or who do not have
      prescriptive authority, may issues an authorization on their office's
      official letterhead or by electronic means for the patient to use during
      the application process.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

      <strong
        >What are the potential penalties to me as a physician/physician
        assistant related to assisting a patient with a disabled parking permit?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A health care practitioner who knowingly provides false information on the
      patient's application is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. The penalty is up
      to 364 days in jail and a fine of up to $5,000 or both. In addition, the
      health care practitioner may be subject to sanctions under chapter 18.130
      RCW, the Uniform Disciplinary Act.<sup

        >What conditions qualify my patient for special parking privileges?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In order to qualify for disabled parking privileges, your patient must
        have a disability that meets at least one of the following criteria:<sup
          ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
        >
        The patient can't walk 200 feet without stopping to rest;
      </li>
      <li>
        The patient's ability to walk is severely limited due to an arthritic,
        neurological, or orthopedic condition;
      </li>
      <li>
        The patient is so severely disabled that he/she can't walk without the
        use of or assistance from a brace, cane, another person, prosthetic
        device, wheelchair, or other assistive device;
      </li>
      <li>The patient uses portable oxygen;</li>
      <li>
        The patient is restricted by lung disease to such an extent that forced
        expiratory respiratory volume when measured by spirometry is less than 1
        liter/second or the arterial oxygen tension is less than 60 mm/hg on
        room air at rest;
      </li>
      <li>
        The patient is impaired by cardiovascular disease or cardiac condition

      </li>
      <li>
        The patient has acute sensitivity to light associated with a form of
        porphyria that would significantly benefit from a decrease in exposure

      </li>
      <li>
        The patient has a disability resulting from an acute sensitivity to
        automobile emissions which limits or impairs his/her ability to walk.

        nurse practitioner must document that the patient's disability is
        comparable in severity to the others listed above.

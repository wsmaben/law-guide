        >What organizational forms are available for a physician's practice?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Generally, a physician's practice may be organized as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A sole proprietorship.</li>
      <li>
        A professional service corporation of the physician alone or with other
        physicians and certain other healthcare professionals.
      </li>
      <li>A partnership with other physicians.</li>
      <li>
        A limited liability partnership with other physicians and certain other
        healthcare professionals.
      </li>
      <li>
        A limited liability company of the physician alone or with other
        physicians and certain other healthcare professionals.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What is a partnership? </strong></p>
    <p>
      A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on a
      business for profit as co-owners.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
      A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.<sup
        ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What is the liability of the partnership as a distinct entity for
        conduct of the partners?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A partnership is liable for any loss or injury to a person, or for any
      penalty which may be incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission,
      or other actionable conduct, of a partner who is acting in the normal
      course of business of the partnership.<sup
        ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup
      >
      A partnership is also responsible for any loss which result if a partner
      acting in the normal course of partnership business, or with the authority
      of the partnership, misapplies money or property the partner has received,
      or received on behalf of the partnership.<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What is the liability of one partner for the acts of the partnership or
        another partner?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Generally, a partner's liability is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Partners are liable for their own acts and omissions, except that a
        person admitted into a partnership is not personally liable for any
        partnership obligation incurred before the person's admission as a
        partner.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Partners are jointly and severally liable for all obligations of the
        partnership unless otherwise agreed upon or provided for in law.<sup
          ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)? </strong></p>
    <p>
      An LLP is a partnership, with statutory limitations on the partners'
      liabilities. The name of a limited liability partnership must contain the
      words "limited liability partnership" or the abbreviation "L.L.P" or "LLP"
      as the last words or letters of its name.<sup
        ><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What is the liability of one partner in an LLP for the acts of the
        partnership or another partner?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Generally, in an LLP, a partner's liability is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Partners are liable for their own acts and omissions.</li>
      <li>
        Partners are liable for the acts and omissions of those they supervise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Partners are not personally liable for the acts and omissions of other
        partners or of employees they do not supervise.<sup
          ><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        The LLP is liable for the acts and omissions of its partners and
        employees.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there special considerations for LLPs whose partners are
        physicians?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Licensed individuals, such as physicians, may organize and become
      members of a LLP for the purpose of rendering professional services.<sup
        ><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup
      >
      In the case of an LLP of licensed professionals, if the partnership fails
      to maintain professional liability insurance or some other equivalent type
      of financial responsibility of at least one million dollars, the partners
      are personally liable for any amounts that would have been covered had the
      professional liability insurance been maintained.<sup
        ><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What is a Professional Service Corporation (PS or PC)? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A professional service corporation is a corporation organized for the
      purpose of providing professional services and comprised of individuals or
      groups of individuals licensed to render the same professional
      services.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> Its existence is
      legally independent from any individual shareholder. It has the capacity
      to act as a distinct legal entity and be held liable for its actions.<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the liability of PS or PC shareholders? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Generally, PS or PC shareholders' liability is as follows:<sup
        ><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shareholders are liable for their own acts and omissions.</li>
      <li>
        Shareholders are liable for the acts and omissions of those they
        supervise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shareholders are not personally liable for the acts and omissions of
        other shareholders or employees they do not supervise.
      </li>
      <li>
        The corporation is liable for the acts and omissions of shareholders and
        employees.
      </li>
      <li>
        The corporation is liable for its contracts, including debt, and other
        liabilities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>What is a Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC)? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A PLLC is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of
      rendering professional services, comprised of individuals or groups of
      individuals who are licensed to render the same professional services,<sup
        ><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup
      >
      and subject to the same laws which govern professional service
      corporations, but which have statutory limitations on the members'
      liabilities.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> A PLLC must
      contain either the words "Professional Limited Liability Company," or the
      words "Professional Limited Liability" and the abbreviation "Co.," or the
      abbreviation ":P.L.L.C." or "PLLC."<sup
        ><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, a PLLC combines features of both a partnership and a
      corporation. A PLLC may function similarly to a partnership in terms of
      taxation, admission of members, voting and classes of membership, and in
      other ways provided for in the limited liability company agreement among
      its members.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is the liability of members of a PLLC? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Generally, the liability of members of a PLLC is as follows:<sup
        ><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Members are liable for their own acts and omissions.</li>
      <li>
        Members are liable for the acts and omissions of those they supervise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Members are not personally liable for the acts and omissions of other
        members or employees they do not supervise.
      </li>
      <li>
        The PLLC is liable for the acts and omissions of members and employees.
      </li>
      <li>
        The PLLC is liable for its contracts, including debt, and other
        liabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the PLLC fails to maintain professional liability insurance or some
        other equivalent form of financial responsibility of at least $1
        million, the members of the PLLC are personally liable for any amounts
        that would have been covered had professional liability insurance been
        maintained.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May physicians combine with any other health care professionals to
        form, and render their professional services through, a professional
        service corporation, a professional limited liability partnership, or a
        professional limited liability company?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain circumstances, yes. Under Washington law provides for licensed
      individuals to incorporate (or form a PLLC) to render the same
      professional service.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>
      Physicians may combine with any of the following licensed health care
      professionals to form, and render their professional services, through a
      professional service corporation, a professional limited liability
      partnership, or a professional limited liability company:<sup
        ><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>East Asian Medicine Practitioners.</li>
      <li>
        Mental health counselors, marriage and family therapists, and social
        workers.
      </li>
      <li>Podiatrists.</li>
      <li>Chiropractors.</li>
      <li>Dental hygienists.</li>
      <li>Dispensing opticians.</li>
      <li>Audiologists and speech language pathologists.</li>
      <li>Naturopaths.</li>
      <li>Midwives</li>
      <li>Optometrists.</li>
      <li>Ocularists.</li>
      <li>Osteopathic physicians.</li>
      <li>Osteopathic physician assistants.</li>
      <li>Pharmacists.</li>
      <li>Physicians.</li>
      <li>Physician assistants.</li>
      <li>Nurses.</li>
      <li>Psychologists.</li>
      <li>Respiratory care practitioners.</li>
      <li>Massage practitioners.</li>
      <li>Dietitians and nutritionists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are combinations of partnerships and corporations possible?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. The law allows any number of combinations of corporate and individual
      partners and/or corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What are some of the factors to consider in choosing the organizational
        form for a physician?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing the best organizational form largely depends upon the physician
      or physicians' personal preferences and consideration of such factors as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taxation issues.</li>
      <li>The impact of the securities laws.</li>
      <li>The time and money required to maintain the business form.</li>
      <li>Entity governance.</li>
      <li>Scope of limitation on personal liability.</li>
      <li>Type of qualified retirement plan desired.</li>
      <li>Requirements of managed health care contracts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Proper formation and maintenance of whatever business entity is chosen for
      physician practices requires detailed compliance with specific laws and
      regulations. Thus, physicians are well-advised to seek legal advice before
      choosing or changing a practice's organizational form.

    <p>
      An osteopathic PA is a health care provider who is licensed by the Board
      of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery (Board) to practice osteopathic
      medicine to a limited extent only under the supervision and control of an
      osteopathic physician.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> All
      osteopathic PAs must wear identification or a badge identifying him or
      herself as an osteopathic PA at all times when meeting or treating
      patients.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

        >What is the difference between an osteopathic physician assistant (PA)
        and a certified osteopathic physician assistant (PA-C)?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A certified osteopathic physician assistant (PA-C) is an individual who
      has successfully completed an accredited and approved physician assistant
      program and has passed the National Commission on Certification of
      Physician Assistants examination.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
      Effective July 1, 1999, an individual applying for a license as a
      physician assistant must have graduated from an accredited and approved
      physician assistant program and must be certified by successful completion
      of the national board examinations.<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
      Applicants for an interim permit will have one year from issuance of the
      interim permit to successfully complete the examination.<sup

    </p>
    <p>
      An osteopathic physician assistant (PA) is an individual who successfully
      completed an accredited and approved osteopathic physician assistant
      program and was licensed in Washington State prior to July 1, 1999:<sup
        ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
      >
      An osteopathic PA may also be an individual who holds an interim permit
      prior to passing the certification.<sup

      <strong
        >What must a osteopathic physician do to utilize a PA in the osteopathic
        physician's practice?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      An osteopathic physician who wishes to use a licensed osteopathic PA must
      obtain approval from the Board.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
      Before commencing practice, a licensed osteopathic PA must apply to the
      Board for permission to be employed or supervised by an osteopathic
      physician or physician group.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> The
      osteopathic physician or physician group and the licensed PA must jointly
      submit to the Board a practice arrangement plan which delineates the
      manner and extent to which the osteopathic PA will practice and be
      supervised.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      A licensed osteopathic PA may practice osteopathic medicine only with the
      Board's approval of the practice arrangement plan and only to the extent
      permitted by the Board.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> A
      licensed osteopathic PA who has not received approval of the practice
      arrangement plan may not practice.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May an osteopathic PA practice in a manner inconsistent with an
        approved practice arrangement plan?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. The Board may take disciplinary action against an osteopathic PA who
      practices outside the approved practice arrangement plan.<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May an osteopathic physician assistants sign documents ordinarily
        signed by a licensed physician?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. An osteopathic physician assistant may sign and attest to any
      document that might ordinarily be signed by a physician, including (but
      not limited to) birth and death certificates.<sup
        ><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Can military experience be used to become licensed as a PA in
        Washington?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. An applicant for a license as an osteopathic physician assistant who
      has military training or experience satisfies the training or experience
      requirements to become licensed as a an osteopathic physician assistant
      unless the Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery determines that the
      military training or experience is not substantially equivalent to the
      standards of this state.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What is the supervising osteopathic physician's liability for the acts
        and omissions of an osteopathic PA?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the supervising osteopathic physician and the osteopathic PA retain
      professional and personal responsibility for the acts and omissions of the
      osteopathic PA.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      A supervising osteopathic physician may be disciplined for aiding and
      abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine if the osteopathic PA is
      permitted to practice medicine beyond the scope of practice approved by
      the Board.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>May an osteopathic PA prescribe legend drugs? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Yes. An osteopathic PA may prescribe, order, administer and dispense
      legend drugs consistent with the scope of practice in an approve
      delegation agreement provided the osteophatic PA has an active DEA
      registration and all prescriptions comply with state and federal
      prescription regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>May an osteopathic PA prescribe controlled substances? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      An osteopathic PA who has been approved by the Board, assigned a
      supervising physician, and has an active DEA registration may issue
      prescriptions for drugs contained in Schedule II through V.<sup
        ><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup
      >
      The prescriptions must comply with state and federal regulations.<sup
        ><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May an osteopathic PA practice in a location other than where the
        supervising osteopathic physician is located?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. An osteopathic PA may practice at a remote site upon approval by the
      Board. A remote practice site means a setting physically separate from the
      supervising osteopathic physician's primary practice location or setting
      where the osteopathic physician is present less than 25% of the practice
      time of the osteopathic PA.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>
      Such approval may be provided if:<sup
        ><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a demonstrated need for such utilization.</li>
      <li>
        Adequate provision exists for immediate communication between the
        supervising osteopathic physician or alternate physician and the
        osteopathic PA.
      </li>
      <li>
        The supervising physician spends at least 10% of the documented and
        scheduled practice time of the osteopathic PA in the remote office site.
      </li>
      <li>
        The names of the supervising osteopathic physician and the osteopathic
        PA must be prominently displayed at the entrance to the clinic or in the
        reception area.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No osteopathic PA holding an interim permit may be utilized in a remote
      practice site.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Must an osteopathic physician review and countersign chart entries made
        by the osteopathic PA?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, to some degree. The osteopathic PA and supervising osteopathic
      physician must ensure that the supervising osteopathic physician provides
      adequate supervision and review of the osteopathic physician assistant's
      practice.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>

        obtain a medical license in Washington?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic eligibility requirements for obtaining a medical license in
      Washington differ depending upon whether the physician is a graduate of a
      medical school in the United States or Canada or is a foreign medical
      graduate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physicians who are graduates of a medical school in the United States or
      Canada must meet at least the following basic requirements:
      <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Graduation from a school of medicine approved by the Washington Medical
        Commission (WMC).
      </li>
      <li>
        Completion of two years of postgraduate medical training in a program
        acceptable to the WMC. (Physicians graduating before July 28, 1985 need
        only one year of postgraduate training.)
      </li>
      <li>Proof of good moral character.</li>
      <li>
        Proof of physical and mental capability to safely practice medicine.
        (The WMC may require a physician to submit to one or more examinations
        to determine that this requirement is met.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Successful completion of the national licensure examination of the
        United States Licensing Examination (USMLE),<sup
          ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup

        or by examinations accepted by the WMC for reciprocity or waiver from
        other states or Canada (National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME),
        Federation of States Medical Boards Examination (FLEX), , or the
        Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC) (provided the
        licensee holds a valid LMCC certification obtained after 1969)).<sup

      </li>
      <li>
        Meet all of the requirements which must be met by graduates of the
        United States and Canadian schools of medicine (see above). However, if
        the foreign medical graduate provides proof satisfactory to the WMC that
        he or she meets the following requirements, completion of two years of
        postgraduate training in a program acceptable to the WMC is not required
        if the applicant:

      A license will not be granted if the applicant has been prohibited from
      practicing medicine in another state because of an act of unprofessional
      conduct that is substantially equivalent to an act of unprofessional

      <strong
        >Are there licensing requirements for physicians regarding AIDS
        education?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Prior to obtaining a license, a physician must have at least four
      hours of education and training on the prevention, transmission, and
      treatment of AIDS.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> The AIDS
      education and training must include&mdash;but is not limited
      to&mdash;etiology and epidemiology; testing and counseling; infection
      control guidelines; clinical manifestations and treatment; legal and
      ethical issues, including confidentiality; and psychosocial issues,
      including special population considerations.<sup
        ><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup
      >
      Upon licensing, a physician must provide a written declaration that he or
      she has completed the minimum AIDS education and training.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
      Physicians must keep records documenting their AIDS training and
      describing what they learned for two years.<sup

        >May a physician who has already been licensed in another state or
        passed the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) examination have
        the examination requirement waived?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. The WMC has the discretion to waive the examination requirement for a
      physician who has previously been licensed in another state or Canada. The
      physician must submit certified copies of the license and show that the
      standards, eligibility requirements and examination of the issuing state
      are at least equal to those in Washington.<sup
        ><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup
      >
      The WMC also has discretion to waive the examination for a physician who
      has successfully passed the NBME, FLEX, USMLE, or examinations given by
      the other states or territories of the United States.<sup
        ><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup
      >
      Physicians who have taken the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada
      (LMCC) and hold a valid LMCC certification obtained after 1969 may be

        >May a physician who has already been licensed in another state receive
        a temporary permit to practice medicine in Washington after his or her
        application is submitted but before it is processed?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, in some circumstances.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>
      Such a physician must file a completed license application form, indicate
      on the form the desire to obtain a temporary permit, and pay the
      application fee and the temporary practice permit fee.<sup
        ><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup
      >
      If the physician is licensed in another state with licensing standards
      substantially equivalent to Washington's licensing standards, the WMC then
      may issue that physician a temporary permit upon receipt of the AMA
      profile verifying the states in which the physician is or was licensed,
      receipt of the disciplinary action data bank report form, and receipt of
      verification from all states in which the physician is or was licensed
      that the physician has a license in good standing and is not subject to
      charges or disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct or
      impairment.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> A physician who
      receives a temporary practice permit may then practice medicine pending
      completion of the application process. The temporary permit, however, is
      good only for 90 days, or upon issuance of license or upon initiation of
      an investigation by the WMC, whichever occurs first.<sup

        obtaining results of a background check?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, provided certain conditions are met.<sup
        ><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup
      >
      The WMC will issue a temporary practice permit if there is a delay in
      receiving the results of a national criminal background check, providing
      that the applicant for a medical license has met all other licensure
      requirements.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> The WMC conducts
      background checks on all applicants for a medical license to assure safe
      patient care.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> The temporary
      practice permit is valid for six months.<sup
        ><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup
      >
      The temporary practice permit is no longer valid after a license is issued
      or action is taken on the application because of the background check.<sup
        ><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>When must a physician's license be renewed? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Physicians must renew their medical licenses every two years.<sup
        ><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup
      >
      The renewal date is the physician's birth date.<sup
        ><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup
      >
      At the time of renewal the WMC requests licensees to submit information
      about their current professional practice, which may include practice
      setting, medical specialty, board certification, or other relevant
      data.<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What happens if a physician fails to renew his or her medical license?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure to renew a license renders the license invalid. A physician who
      continues to practice medicine with an invalid license is engaged in the
      unauthorized practice of medicine, which is both a crime and
      unprofessional conduct which may subject the physician to disciplinary
      action.<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a license has expired because of failure to renew for one renewal cycle
      or less, a physician must pay the late renewal penalty fee, the current
      renewal fee, and the required substance abuse monitoring surcharge (to
      support the Washington Physicians Health Program (WPHP)), provide any
      required documentation or declaration, and comply with the WMC continuing
      medical education (CME) requirements.<sup
        ><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      If a physician's license has been expired for more than one renewal cycle,
      but less than three years or less, a physician must also file an
      abbreviated application form and pay all outstanding fees and penalty fees
      and comply with the other requirements listed above, pay an expired
      credential reissuance fee. In addition, the physician must provide written
      declarations that (i) no action has been taken by any state, the federal
      government, or hospital to restrict the physician's practice of medicine,
      (ii) the physician has not voluntarily given up any credential or
      privilege, or has not had his or her practice restricted, in order to
      avoid formal action, and (iii) the CME and competency requirements of the
      past two years have been met.<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a physician's license has been expired for more than three years the
      physician must satisfy all of the requirements above (for a licensed
      expired more than one renewal cycle but less than three years) but must
      also satisfy other competency requirements set forth by the WMC, and
      provide proof of AIDS education, if not previously provided.<sup
        ><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup
      >
      In addition, the physician must furnish proof that the physician has
      completed two years of postgraduate training in a program acceptable to
      the WMC.<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p><strong>Does Washington issue any limited licenses? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The WMC may, without examination, issue a limited license to the
      following:<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Physicians who are licensed in another state or Canada, who have been
        accepted for employment by DSHS, the Department of Corrections (DOC), or
        any county or city health department, and who meet all of the basic
        qualifications for licensure. Such a license shall permit the physician
        to practice medicine only in connection with patients, residents, or
        inmates under the supervision and control of DSHS or the DOC, or in
        conjunction with the physician's duties in employment with a city or
        county health department.
      </li>
      <li>
        Physicians who have submitted a completed application showing that they
        meet all of the basic requirements except for completion of two years of
        postgraduate medical training and who have been appointed as a resident
        physician in a program of postgraduate clinical training in this state
        approved by the WMC.
      </li>
      <li>
        Physicians who have graduated from a recognized medical school, who have
        been licensed or otherwise privileged to practice medicine at their
        location of origin, and who have been invited to serve as a
        teaching-research member of the University of Washington School of
        Medicine or of a hospital or health care facility licensed in this
        state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Physicians who have graduated from a recognized medical school, who have
        been granted a license or other appropriate certificate to practice
        medicine in their location of origin, and who have been selected by the
        University of Washington School of Medicine or a hospital or health care
        facility licensed in this state to be enrolled in one of its designated
        fellowship programs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Commissioned medical officers serving in the United States armed forces

        >Do medical students in Washington need to be licensed to practice
        medicine?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, as long as the person is a regular student in a school of medicine
      approved and accredited by the WMC and only performs services pursuant to
      a regular course of instruction or assignments from his or her instructor
      or under the supervision and control of a licensed physician.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is a retired active physician license? </strong></p>
    <p>
      A retired active physician license permits a physician who is already
      licensed to retire and continue to practice in emergent or intermittent
      circumstances provided that the physician provides services without
      compensation.<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain a retired active physician license, a physician must submit a
      letter to the WMC with the license renewal declaring the physician's
      intent to practice only on an intermittent or emergency basis as described
      above.<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> Retired active licenses
      must be renewed every two years, but are renewed at a reduced rate.<sup
        ><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup

      A retired active status licensee must report one hundred hours of

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A physician with a retired active physician license who wishes to return
      to a full active license must notify the WMC in writing of the change, pay
      all required fees, and meet the current requirements for licensure.<sup

        obtain a license or for a license to remain effective?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Insurance is not a requirement to obtain a license or for a license to
      remain effective.<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> Some
      hospitals and clinics, however, may require that a physician have

    <p>
      Retired volunteer medical workers may only practice when there is a
      declared emergency, disaster, or authorized training event that has been
      given a mission number by the Department of Emergency Management, and the
      local organization for emergency services or management has activated the
      retired volunteer medical worker.<sup
        ><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup
      >
      The retired volunteer medical worker may only work the duties assigned,
      must be supervised, and may only perform the duties that were associated
      with their previous medical practice.<sup
        ><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup
      >
      In order to apply for a retired volunteer medical worker license a
      physician must meet the requirements listed above, submit an application
      to the Department of Health, and submit proof of current registration as a
      volunteer emergency worker with a local organization for emergency
      services or management.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>
      Retired volunteer medical workers will be required to maintain competency
      requirements that are established by the Secretary of Health. A retired
      volunteer physician must complete a basic first-aid course, a bloodborne
      pathogens course and a CPR course every three years in order to renew his
      or her license.<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> A physician
      who holds a retired volunteer medical license, and is registered as an
      emergency worker, is immune from liability for his or her actions while
      providing assistance in an emergency or disaster, or while participating
      in an approved training exercise or preparation for an emergency or
      disaster.<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> This immunity does
      not apply to acts of gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. See

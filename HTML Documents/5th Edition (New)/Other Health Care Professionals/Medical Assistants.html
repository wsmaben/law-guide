      <h1>Medical Assistants</h1>
      <p><strong>What are Medical Assistants? </strong></p>
      <p>
         Medical assistants (MAs) are health care professionals who have been
         specifically trained to work in settings such as physicians' offices,
         medical clinics, medical group practices, and other health care
         facilities. MAs are individuals who have been trained to perform
         administrative and clinically-related procedures under the supervision
         of health care providers.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong
            >How are Medical Assistants different from Health Care Assistants?
         </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         Health care assistants (HCAs) were only recognized in Washington State,
         and had a very limited scope of practice set forth in statute and
         administrative rules. HCAs were not permitted to perform any task which
         is within the scope of practice of a licensed health care provider
         except as provided in law. Under the law prior to July 1, 2013 HCAs
         were not permitted to perform tasks such as taking vital signs and
         performing simple tests (dipstick urinalysis, urine pregnancy test,
         etc.) because they were not included in the HCA scope of practice, but
         are included in the scope of practice of licensed health care
         providers.
      </p>
      <p>
         Medical assistants (MAs) are much more widely recognized across the
         United States, and generally have a broader scope of practice. This
         allows MAs to assist medical practices in a wider variety of tasks
         associated with patient care. There are also a number of medical
         specialties which use certain assistive personnel who may or may not be
         trained as MAs, who nonetheless perform vital specialty-specific tasks.
      </p>

            >What is new in Washington State regarding Medical Assistants?
         </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         The Department of Health (DOH) has new statutes and rules which went
         into effect July 1, 2013 which establish credentials for Medical
         Assistants in Washington. The laws created four categories of Medical
         Assistant which will be discussed in greater detail below:<sup
            ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
         >
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>MA-Certified (MA-C)</li>
         <li>MA-Registered (MA-R)</li>
         <li>MA-Phlebotomist (MA-P); and</li>
         <li>MA-Hemodialysis Technician (MA-HT).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <strong
            >What happened to individuals who were Health Care Assistants July
            1, 2013?
         </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         Health care assistants who were credentialed and in good standing as of
         July 1, 2013 transitioned into one or more of the categories of MAs.
         Health care assistants in Category C, B, D, or F became Medical
         Assistants-Certified (MA-C).<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
         Health care assistants in Category A or B became Medical
         Assistants-Phlebotomist (MA-P).<sup
            ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
         >
         Health care assistants in Category G became Medical
         Assistants-Hemodialysis Technician (MA-HT).<sup
            ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup
         >
         Multiple certifications as MAs were possible depending on the health
         care assistant certifications held by an individual. No health care
         assistant automatically transitioned into the Medical
         Assistant-Registered category.

         An individual who has met all of the requirements listed above, except
         for the passage of one of the examinations approved by the DOH, may
         practice as a MA-C under an interim certification for a period of up to
         one year.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> An individual

         requirements to become a Medical Assistant unless the DOH determines
         that the military training or experience is not substantially
         equivalent to the standards established in Washington State.

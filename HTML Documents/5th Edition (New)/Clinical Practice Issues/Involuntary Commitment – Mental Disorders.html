	Involuntary Commitment &ndash; Mental Disorders
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Who may be involuntarily committed for mental disorders? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Generally, persons suffering from a mental disorder may not be involuntarily committed. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The exceptions to this general rule are: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Minors, age 13 or older, who as a result of a mental disorder are gravely disabled or who present a likelihood of serious harm to themselves or others. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> </li>
	<li>Minors under age 13 admitted on the application of the minor's parent. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></li>
	<li>Persons who are developmentally disabled, impaired by chronic alcoholism or drug abuse, or dementia, if they are either gravely disabled or present a likelihood of serious harm to themselves or others. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></li>
	<li>Persons voluntarily admitted who request release, and who, as a result of a mental disorder, present an imminent likelihood of serious harm to themselves or others, or who are gravely disabled. <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></li>
	<li>Persons who are found by the court to be sexual psychopaths. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></li>
	<li>Persons committed or confined to a state correctional institution or facility, when in the judgment of the secretary of corrections, and with the consent of the secretary of DSHS, the welfare of such persons necessitates their transfer, for observation, diagnosis or treatment, to a state institution or facility for the care of the mentally ill. <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></li>
	<li>Criminal defendants charged with felonies who are found by the court to be incompetent to stand trial. <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></li>
	<li>Criminal defendants who pleaded guilty by reason of insanity, or if there are doubts about his or her competency may be committed without an initial assessment of the defendant's mental condition if the defendant is charged with first or second degree murder, if it is likely that an assessment in jail will not be adequate, or if the court finds that assessment outside the jail setting is necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the defendant. <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></li>
	<li>Criminal defendants acquitted of a felony by reason of insanity, if the court finds that they present either a substantial danger to others or a substantial likelihood of committing felonious acts jeopardizing public safety or security, unless kept under further control by the court or other persons or institutions. <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>How is the involuntary commitment process initiated for persons who, as a result of a mental disorder, are gravely disabled or dangerous to themselves or others? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	The involuntary commitment process is usually initiated by the filing of a petition for initial detention by the county-designated Mental Health Professional (MHP). <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> When the county-designated MHP receives information that a person, age 13 or older, as a result of a mental disorder, is gravely disabled or presents a likelihood of serious harm to self or others, the MHP investigates and evaluates the facts and interviews the person. <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> If the county-designated MHP is then satisfied that the person is gravely disabled or dangerous as a result of a mental disorder and that the person will not voluntarily seek appropriate treatment, the MHP may take the minor into custody, transport the minor to an inpatient evaluation and treatment facility, and then file a petition for initial detention. <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>May a physician detain a person who is brought to an evaluation and treatment facility or hospital emergency department in order to enable a county-designated MHP to evaluate the person? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Yes, under certain circumstances. If the person is an adult and refuses voluntary admission, and if the professional staff of the facility or hospital believes that the person, as a result of a mental disorder, presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm to self or others, or presents an imminent danger because of grave disability, then the professional staff may detain the person for up to six hours to enable the county-designated MHP to evaluate the person. <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> The six-hour period to detain a person does not begin until the hospital staff determines the necessity for further evaluation by the MHP. <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	If the person is a minor, age 13 or older, and if the professional person in charge determines that the minor suffers from a mental disorder, that inpatient treatment is required, and that the minor is unwilling to consent to voluntary admission, and if the professional person believes that the minor meets the criteria for initial detention, then the minor may be detained for up to 12 hours to enable the county-designated MHP to evaluate the minor. <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>May a physician be held civilly or criminally liable with regard to decisions to admit, release, or detain a person for evaluation and treatment? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Generally, no, as long as such decisions were made in good faith and without gross negligence. <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Does an involuntarily committed patient have a choice of physicians? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Yes. Involuntarily committed patients must be given a reasonable choice of an available physician or other professional person qualified to provide the needed services. <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Can antipsychotic medication be administered to an involuntarily committed patient without the patient's informed consent? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Under limited circumstances, yes. If antipsychotic medication is used, the physician must attempt to obtain the patient's informed consent. <sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> A patient's right to refuse antipsychotic medications does not apply when a patient is gravely disabled or present a likelihood it is determined that the failure to medicate may result in a likelihood of serious harm or substantial deterioration, or substantially prolonging the length of involuntary commitment, so long as there is no less intrusive treatment that is in the patient's best interests. <sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> Under state rules, Antipsychotic drugs may be administered without the patient's consent when an emergency exists and there is a review of the decision within 24 hours. <sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> For purposes of such administration, an "emergency" exists when the patient presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm to self or others, medically acceptable alternatives to administration of antipsychotic medications are not available or are unlikely to be successful, and in the opinion of the physician, physician assistant, or psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, the person's condition constitutes an emergency requiring the treatment be instituted before obtaining a second medical opinion. <sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> Absent an emergency, antipsychotic may be administered over a patient's objections or lack of consent when there is an additional concurring opinion by a second physician for treatment up to 30 days. <sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> Additional requirements apply for continued treatment beyond 30 days. <sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> In criminal cases, the court may authorize involuntary medication for the purpose of competency restoration if the defendant is charged with a serious offense. <sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>May a physician be held civilly or criminally liable for a decision to administer antipsychotic medications to an involuntarily committed person? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Generally, no, as long as such decision was made in good faith and without gross negligence. <sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>What general rights are afforded to patients who are involuntarily committed? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	The following rights afforded to all patients who have been involuntarily committed: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>No person shall be presumed incompetent solely as a result of receiving an evaluation, or voluntary or involuntary treatment for a mental disorder. <sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> </li>
	<li>Each patient has the right to adequate care and individualized treatment. <sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup></li>
	<li>Each patient shall have the right to treatment by spiritual means through prayer in accordance with their beliefs. <sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup></li>
	<li>Each patient must be given a reasonable choice of available physician, or other health care provider qualified to provide treatment. <sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Must a patient who is involuntarily committed for a mental disorder be provided with a statement of rights? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Whenever a person is detained for evaluation and treatment, state law requires that both the person and, if possible, a responsible member of the person's immediate family or the person's guardian must be advised as soon as possible in writing or orally that unless the person is released or consents to voluntary admission for treatment within 72 hours of the initial detention that: <sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A judicial hearing in the superior court will be held within 72 hours of the initial detention.</li>
	<li>The person has the right to communicate immediately with an attorney.</li>
	<li>The person has the right to remain silent and that any statement may be used against him or her at the hearing.</li>
	<li>The person has the right to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses at the hearing.</li>
	<li>The person has the right to refuse medications, including antipsychotic medications, beginning 24 hours prior to the hearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition, state rules specifically require that patients who have been involuntarily committed must be informed orally or in writing in the primary language spoken/used/understood by the person that he or she has the right to: <sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A judicial hearing in a superior court, either by a judge or court commissioner thereof, not more than seventy-two hours after the initial detention to determine whether there is probable cause to detain the person after the seventy-two hours have expired for up to an additional fourteen days without further automatic hearing for the reason that the person is a person whose mental disorder or substance use disorder presents a likelihood of serious harm or that the person is gravely disabled</li>
	<li>Communicate immediately with an attorney</li>
	<li>Have an attorney appointed to represent him or her before and at the probable cause hearing if he or she is indigent</li>
	<li>Be told the name and address of the attorney that the mental health professional has designated</li>
	<li>Remain silent and that any statement he or she makes may be used against him or her</li>
	<li>Present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses who testify against him or her at the probable cause hearing</li>
	<li>Refuse psychiatric medications, including antipsychotic medication beginning twenty-four hours prior to the probable cause hearing.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	A detained person retains certain other rights, including the rights to wear his or her own clothing, use personal possessions, use a reasonable amount of money for canteen expenses and small purchases, access individual storage space, receive visitors at reasonable times, have reasonable access to a telephone and writing materials, discuss treatment plans and decisions with professionals, refuse consent to antipsychotic medications (unless mandated pursuant to a hearing), refuse consent to electroconvulsive therapy or psychosurgery, and deal with property or contracts unless declared incompetent in a court proceeding. <sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	A person must be given a written statement of his rights upon leaving a facility following evaluation or treatment for a mental disorder. <sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>May the parent of a minor initiate inpatient mental health treatment of the minor without the minor's consent? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Yes. A parent may bring, or authorize the bringing of, his or her minor child, even one age 13 or older, to an evaluation and treatment facility and request that the professional person examine the minor to determine whether the minor has a mental disorder and is in need of inpatient treatment. <sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> The consent of the minor is not required for admission, evaluation, and treatment if the parent brings the minor to the facility. <sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> Parental authorization, or the authorization of a person who may otherwise legally consent on behalf of a child, is required for inpatient treatment of a minor under 13 years of age. <sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	A professional person in charge (a physician or other mental health professional empowered by an evaluation and treatment facility with authority to make admission and discharge decisions) <sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> may evaluate whether the minor has a mental disorder. <sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> The evaluation must be completed within 24 hours of the time the minor was brought to the facility unless the professional person determines that the minor's condition necessitates additional time for evaluation. <sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> In no event may the minor be held more than 72 hours for evaluation. <sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	If, in the judgment of the professional person, it is determined that it is a medical necessity for the adolescent to receive inpatient treatment, the adolescent may be held for treatment. <sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> Within 24 hours of completion of the evaluation, the professional person must notify DSHS if the child is held for treatment and of the date of admission. <sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> Within not less than 7 nor more than 14 days after the date the adolescent was brought to the facility, DSHS must assure that any adolescent admitted to inpatient treatment at the initiation of a parent receives an independent review by a physician or other mental health professional to determine whether it is a medical necessity to continue the adolescent's treatment on an inpatient basis. <sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	No provider is obligated to provide treatment to an adolescent brought to an evaluation and treatment facility by a parent.<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> Nor may a provider admit a minor under such circumstances unless it is medically necessary. <sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	Parents of a child must be given a notice by the evaluation and treatment center that includes all of the available treatment options for the child allowed by law and the procedures to be followed to utilize the treatment options. <sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	No minor receiving inpatient treatment under such circumstances may be discharged from the facility based solely on his or her request, <sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> but must be discharged immediately upon written request of the parent. <sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> Before the DSHS independent review is conducted, the professional person must notify the minor of his or her right to petition the superior court for release from the facility. <sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

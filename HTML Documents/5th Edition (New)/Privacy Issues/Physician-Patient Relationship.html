<h1>Physician-Patient Relationship</h1>
<p><strong>When is the physician-patient relationship created?</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, the physician-patient relationship is created when a patient consults a physician for the purpose of health care, including prevention, treatment, management of illness, and preservation of mental and physical well-being. It is not necessary for the creation of the relationship that the physician actually treat the patient.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Whether a physician-patient relationship is created depends on whether the patient believes that the patient's contact with the physician was for the purposes of treatment. Regarding a child, parents do not have a physician-patient relationship themselves with a physician treating their child, but have the right to act as in a representative capacity for their child with regard to informed consent.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Usually, no relationship is formed when the physician is merely evaluating the patient at the request of a third party. However, workplace examinations of employees may, depending on the circumstances, give rise to a physician-patient relationship.
</p>
<p><strong>Is the physician-patient relationship created when a patient calls for an appointment?
</strong></p>
<p>
If confidential information is given or medical advice is conveyed over the phone, the physician-patient relationship may have been created.
</p>
<p><strong>Does the initial appointment create the relationship?</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>What can patients expect from the physician-patient relationship?
</strong></p>
<p>
The American Medical Association encourages physicians to foster certain rights for patients in order to maximize the effectiveness of medical treatment. These rights include the patients' right to:<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receive information from the physician and to discuss the risks and benefits, and the costs, of appropriate treatment alternatives;</li>
	<li>Make decisions regarding health care that is recommended by the physician, including the right to refuse care;</li>
	<li>Courtesy, respect, dignity, responsiveness, and timely attention to their needs;</li>
	<li>Confidentiality; </li>
	<li>Continuity and coordination of health care; and</li>
	<li>Have adequate health care available.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Must a physician render medical care to anyone requesting it?
</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, no. A managed care contract, however, may require a physician to treat any of the health plan's members who select the physician. Moreover, a physician is prohibited from refusing treatment on the basis of sex, race, national origin, religion, or disability. See DISCRIMINATION and <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Practice_Management_Issues/Americans_With_Disabilities_Act.aspx">AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT</a>. A physician also may not refuse to treat a patient because the patient has AIDS or is HIV positive. See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/AIDS-HIV-STD.aspx">AIDS/HIV/STD</a>.
</p>
<p>
A physician may refuse to withdraw or withhold life support services. See LIVING WILLS. A physician may also refuse to perform an abortion. See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Beginning_Of_Life_And_Childhood_Issues/Abortion.aspx">ABORTION</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>How does a physician terminate a physician-patient relationship?
</strong></p>
<p>
A physician may terminate a relationship with a patient by written notice to the patient which provides adequate time and opportunity for the patient to obtain care from another physician.
</p>
<p><strong>What steps should a physician take to properly terminate a patient relationship?
</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, a physician should take at least the following steps to properly terminate a physician-patient relationship:<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure the patient is stabilized.</li>
	<li>Assuming the patient is stabilized, inform the patient verbally and in writing of what follow-up care, if any, is needed.</li>
	<li>Inform the patient in writing, by letter sent certified mail return receipt requested, of the physician's intent to terminate the physician-patient relationship and of the specific date that the physician intends to stop rendering care.</li>
	<li>Make sure the date specified in the letter gives the patient adequate time to find another suitable physician to provide care.</li>
	<li>If possible, provide the patient with a list of physicians qualified to treat the patient's condition to contact for alternative referrals.</li>
	<li>Advise the patient that the physician will remain available to render care until the date specified in the letter.</li>
	<li>Inform the patient that copies of the patient's medical record will be made available either to the patient or to the patient's new physician upon request and with a valid authorization.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A physician's failure to properly terminate the physician-patient relationship can result in allegations of abandonment.
</p>
<p><strong>Must a physician follow and treat a patient with a chronic illness?
</strong></p>
<p>
Generally, once the physician begins care, the obligation to provide treatment continues until the patient is stabilized and the physician-patient relationship is properly terminated. It is advisable for a physician to formally terminate the relationship once a physician decides not to continue to seeing the patient. Because questions as to whether to terminate a physician-patient relationship are often fact-specific, a physician is well-advised to consult an attorney.

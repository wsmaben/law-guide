    <p><strong>When is an individual legally considered "dead"? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Under Washington law, an individual is "dead" when it is determined
      according to accepted medical standards that the individual has sustained
      either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions; or
      </li>
      <li>
        Irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including
        the brain stem.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What is the legal definition of a "fetal death"? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Under Washington law, a "fetal death" occurs when any product of
      conception, after complete expulsion or extraction from its mother, shows
      no evidence of life such as breathing, beating of the heart, pulsating of
      the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.<sup
        ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Must a death certificate be prepared and filed for all deaths?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, with one exception&mdash;no certificate is required for fetal deaths
      if the period of gestation is less than 20 weeks.<sup
        ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>Who must prepare and file the death certificate? </strong></p>
    <p>
      The funeral director or the person with the right to dispose of the
      deceased's remains <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> must prepare
      and file the death certificate. In preparing the certificate, he or she
      must present the death certificate to the physician, physician's
      assistant, or advanced registered nurse practitioner who last attended the
      deceased or who was in attendance at the fetal death. Within two business
      days, the physician, physician's assistant, or advanced registered nurse
      practitioner must certify the cause of death according to her or his best
      knowledge and then sign or electronically approve the certificate unless
      good cause for not doing so within this timeframe can be established.<sup
        ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      If the deceased died without medical attendance, the health officer,
      medical examiner, coroner, or prosecuting attorney having jurisdiction
      must similarly certify the cause of death and sign or electronically
      approve the certification. If the circumstances suggest the cause of death
      (or fetal death) was caused by unlawful or unnatural causes the individual
      completing or signing the death certificate noting only that no physician,
      PA, or ARNP was in attendance at the time of death. If there is no
      suspicion of death from unlawful or unnatural causes, the death
      certificate should note that no physician, PA, or ARNP was in attendance
      at the time of death, and also note the cause of death without the holding
      of an inquest or performing an autopsy, but from statements of family or
      persons in attendance at the time of death or during the deceased
      individual's last illness, or others who have an adequate knowledge of the
      facts.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Can a county coroner or medical examiner be liable for erroneously
        determining the cause of death?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. A physician acting as a county coroner or medical examiner is immune
      from civil liability for determining the cause and manner of death.<sup
        ><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>When and where must a death certificate be filed? </strong></p>
    <p>
      If the place of death is known, a death certificate must be filed with the
      local registrar of the district where the death occurred within three
      business days after the death becomes known.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the place of death is not known, the death certificate must be filed
      with the local registrar of the district where the body's remains are
      discovered within one business day of the discovery.<sup
        ><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The death certificate must be filed before the body's interment or other
      disposition.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> If after three
      business days, however, the cause of death still cannot be
      determined&mdash;and thus the certificate cannot yet be certified and
      filed&mdash;the deceased's attending physician must give a written
      explanation for the delay to the local registrar of the district where the
      death occurred so that a permit for the body's disposition can be
      issued.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there penalties for failing to comply with death certificate
        requirements?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Failure to comply with death certificate requirements is a
      misdemeanor; repeated violations may subject a physician to a fine of up
      to $250, imprisonment for up to 90 days, or both.<sup
        ><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup
      >
      Also, willfully providing false information for or making any false
      statement on a death certificate is a gross misdemeanor.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup

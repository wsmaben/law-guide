<p><strong>What information regarding malpractice payments for physicians must be reported to the NPDB?
</strong></p>
<p>
Medical malpractice payers must report to the NPDB any payment made on behalf of a physician in full or partial settlement or satisfaction of a written medical malpractice claim or judgment against a physician.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> The report must be made by the payer within 30 days of the payment and the report must include, among other things: <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The name, address (work, and home if known), social security number, date of birth, each professional school attended (and year of graduation), and license number of the physician for whose benefit the payment was made (including the field of licensure and state of issue);</li>
	<li>DEA number;</li>
	<li>The name of any hospital with which the physician is associated; </li>
	<li>The name of the entity making the payment and the name and contact information for the individual submitting the report;</li>
	<li>Relationship of the reporting entity to the physician on whose behalf the payment was made;</li>
	<li>Where a legal action or claim has been filed with a court, the identification of the court, and the case number;</li>
	<li>Date(s) on which the action(s) or omission(s) that were the basis of the action or claim occurred;</li>
	<li>The date of judgment or settlement;</li>
	<li>The amount of the payment;</li>
	<li>A description of the acts or omissions and injuries or illnesses upon which the claim was based;</li>
	<li>Classification of the acts or omissions according to codes required by the NPDB; and</li>
	<li>Any other information that may be required in the future after the requirements have been published and adopted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There may be some exceptions to the reporting requirements if a physician's circumstances differ from those described above. In that case physicians are advised to seek legal counsel regarding reporting. Note also that the waiver of an outstanding debt is not considered a "payment" and is not reportable.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What information regarding licensure actions against a physician must be reported to the NPDB?
</strong></p>
<p>
The following information must be reported to the NPDB by the Medical Quality Assurance Commission (MQAC) within 30 days of the action based on reasons related to a physician's professional competence or professional conduct:<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any surrender of a physician's license.</li>
	<li>Any revocation, suspension, or restriction of a physician's license.</li>
	<li>Any censure, reprimand, or probation of a physician, for reasons relating to the physician's professional competence or conduct as the result of a formal proceeding. Matters resolved by a stipulation to informal disposition (STID), which are not formal disciplinary actions, are nonetheless subject to public disclosure, and must also be reported.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> See Medical Discipline. </li>
	<li> The MQAC must include the physician's name, work address, home address if known, social security number if known, date of birth, each professional school attended, date of graduation, and license number, DEA number, a description of the acts or omissions for which the discipline was imposed, a description of the action taken by the MQAC, and the classification of the action under the NPDB reporting codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the following licensure actions taken by a state as the result of a formal proceeding must be reported:<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any dismissal or closure of a formal proceeding by reason of the physician surrendering his/her license, or leaving the state or jurisdiction. </li>
	<li>Any other loss of the physician's license whether by operation of law, voluntary surrender (excluding those due to non-payment of licensure renewal fees, retirement, or change to inactive status), or otherwise. </li>
	<li>Any negative action or finding by such authority, organization, or entity regarding the physician.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What information regarding adverse professional review actions on clinical privileges taken against a physician must be reported to the NPDB?
</strong></p>
<p>
Each health care entity must report information concerning an adverse professional review action whenever:<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The entity takes a professional review action that adversely affects a physician's clinical privileges for more than 30 days.</li>
	<li>The entity accepts the surrender of clinical privileges of a physician in either of the following circumstances:</li>
	<li>While the physician is under an investigation relating to possible incompetence or improper professional conduct.</li>
	<li>In return for not conducting such an investigation or proceeding.</li>
	<li>A professional society takes a professional review action, based on reasons relating to professional competence or conduct, which adversely affects the membership of a physician in the society.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The entity must report such adverse professional review actions to the MQAC within 15 days of reviewing the entity's report. The MQAC must then report the action to the NPDB.
</p>
<p><strong>Can a physician dispute a NPDB report?</strong></p>
<p>
Yes.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> A physician may dispute either of the following, within 60 days of the date the report is mailed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The factual accuracy of a report.</li>
	<li>Whether a report was submitted in accordance with the NPDB requirements, including the eligibility of the entity to make the report.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When disputing the accuracy of a report, the physician must:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inform the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the reporting entity, in writing, of the disagreement, and the basis for it.</li>
	<li>Request that the disputed information be entered into a "disputed" status, and be so related to inquirers.</li>
	<li>Attempt to enter into a discussion with the reporting entity to resolve the dispute.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The physician may not, however, dispute a report in order to do any of the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Protest an insurer's decision to settle a claim.</li>
	<li>Appeal the underlying reasons for an adverse action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does a physician dispute a report to the NPDB?
</strong></p>
<p>
When the NPDB processes a report, the NPDB sends a notification letter to the subject of the report. The notification includes the report number, a temporary password, and instructions to access the report online.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> The physician should review the report for accuracy and, if any information in the report is inaccurate, contact the reporting entity to correct the information. 
</p>
<p>
A physician who disagrees with the factual accuracy of a report has three options if the reporting entity will not correct the information:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add a statement to the report.</li>
	<li>Initiate a dispute of the report (must be done within 60 days from the date the report was mailed).</li>
	<li>Add a statement and initiate a dispute.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To add a statement or to dispute the report, the physician should follow the applicable instructions in the notification letter or online. More information about how dispute a report and/or file a statement can be found at: <a href="https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/pract/aboutRespondingToReports.jsp">https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/pract/aboutRespondingToReports.jsp</a>. 
</p>
<p><strong>Who must query the NPDB for information concerning a physician?
</strong></p>
<p>
A hospital must request information from the NPDB whenever a physician applies to the hospital for admission to the medical staff or for clinical privileges, and at least every two years for all physicians who are on the medical staff or have clinical privileges.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

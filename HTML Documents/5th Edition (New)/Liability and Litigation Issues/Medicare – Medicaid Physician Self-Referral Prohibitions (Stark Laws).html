<h1>Medicare - Medicaid Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions (Stark Laws)</h1>
<p>
NOTE: Analysis of potential physician self-referral issues is very complex and fact-specific. The Stark law and how it is interpreted changes frequently. Almost all of the exceptions to the laws and regulations prohibiting self-referral require compliance with multiple specific conditions. Physicians are well-advised to seek legal advice before assuming that their ownership or investment interests or compensation arrangements with referral sources do not violate the Stark laws. The Legal Resource Center of the Washington State Medical Association (<a href="https://wsma.org">https://wsma.org</a>) can assist you in identifying attorneys experienced in Stark and other self-referral questions.
</p>
<p><strong>What is the Stark law?
</strong></p>
<p>
The phrase "Stark" law refers to a law named after the former congressman from California, Peter Stark. Sometimes people refer to Stark I, Stark II, and Stark II, which refer to a series of regulations implementing the law. 
</p>
<p><strong>What does the Stark laws prohibit?
</strong></p>
<p>
Unless an exception applies, a physician who has a direct or indirect financial relationship with an entity (whether through ownership or compensation), or who has an immediate family member who has a direct or indirect financial relationship with the entity, may not make a referral to that entity for the furnishing of designated health services (DHS) payable by Medicare or Medicaid.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Stark also prohibits an entity providing the DHS from billing for any DHS furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Does intent matter?
</strong></p>
<p>
No. Unlike the False Claims Act and federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark law is a strict liability statute. No intent to violate the law is needed. 
</p>
<p><strong>What are the penalties for violating the Stark laws?
</strong></p>
<p>
The sanctions for violations of the Stark laws are harsh and include the following: (1) no payment for a DHS furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral; <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> (2) an obligation to repay all amounts improperly billed; <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> (3) civil money penalties of up to $15,000 per each improperly billed service; <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> (4) civil money penalties of up to $100,000 against any physician or entity that enters into any circumvention arrangement or scheme which the physician or entity knew or should have known has a principal purpose of assuring referrals; <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> (5) civil money penalties of up to $10,000 each day for which a required report has not been made; <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> (6) exclusion from participation in Medicare or Medicaid; <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> and/or (7) assessment of not more than three times the amount claimed for each item or service improperly claimed.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Is there a way to limit potential penalties for violating the Stark law? 
</strong></p>
<p>
Potentially. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has developed the Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol (SRDP) for providers who have discovered Stark law violations and wish to make a voluntary disclosure, resolve their repayment obligations with CMS, and potentially receive a reduction in the amounts due and owing as a result of the violation.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Providers seeking to utilize this option should seek the advice of legal counsel. 
</p>
<p><strong>What are designated health services or DHS?
</strong></p>
<p>
The "designated health services" (DHS) encompassed in the Stark laws and regulations include the following items or services when payable by Medicare or Medicaid:<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clinical laboratory services.*</li>
	<li>Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and outpatient speech-language pathology services.*</li>
	<li>Radiology services, including x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans, ultrasound services, and nuclear medicine.*</li>
	<li>Note that with regard to certain imaging services, including MRI, CT, and PET scans, the referring physician must provide written notice (which must meet certain requirements set forth in regulations) to the patient at the time of the referral that the patient may receive the same service from a person other than the referring physician or the physician's group.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> </li>
	<li>Radiation therapy services and supplies.*</li>
	<li>Durable medical equipment and supplies.</li>
	<li>Parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies.</li>
	<li>Prosthetics, orthotics, and prosthetic devices and supplies.</li>
	<li>Home health services.</li>
	<li>Outpatient prescription drugs.</li>
	<li>Inpatient and outpatient hospital services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
*The list of CPT and HCPCS codes for the specific services that are considered DHS under the above categories that are followed by an asterisk is updated annually in the physician fee schedule final rule and on the CMS website.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Are there are any exceptions to the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark laws?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Stark has exceptions that cover either specific referrals or financial relationships (i.e., if there is no financial relationship between the parties, then Stark does not regulate the referral). The exceptions contain multiple enumerated requirements which must be met. Given the strict liability and severe consequences of noncompliance, physicians and entities should seek legal counsel to ensure that they are strictly complying with any exceptions. 
</p>
<p>
Frequently used exceptions for referrals include the physicians' services and in-office ancillary services exceptions.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Frequently used exceptions for financial relationships include, without limitation, the following: (1) ownership or investment interests in certain publicly traded investment securities and mutual funds; <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> (2) payments made for certain office space <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> and equipment rentals; <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> (3) payments made by an employer to an employee who has a true ("bona fide") employment arrangement with the employer <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> and payments made under certain personal service arrangements; <sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> (4) certain hospital physician recruitment incentives; <sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> (5) payments made in connection with isolated financial transactions, such as a one-time sale of property or practice; <sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> and (6) certain payments related to electronic prescribing or electronic health records items and services.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Does compliance with the Stark laws ensure compliance with the Medicare-Medicaid anti-kickback law or Washington's anti-rebate law?
</strong></p>
<p>
No. See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Medicare_Medicaid_Fraud_And_Abuse_And_Anti_Kickback_Provisions.aspx">MEDICARE - MEDICAID FRAUD AND ABUSE AND ANTI-KICKBACK PROVISIONS</a>; and <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Rebates.aspx">REBATES</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Where can physicians find more information concerning the Stark laws?
</strong></p>
<p>

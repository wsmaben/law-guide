<h1>Pain Management</h1>
<p>
In response to the opioid epidemic, the Legislature passed <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1427&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2017">HB 1427</a> (2017), which required comprehensive opioid prescribing rulemaking effective Jan. 1, 2019. These rules cover all phases of pain, from acute to chronic, and among other mandates, requires physicians to register with the PMP, check the database at the first refill, and create treatment plans.

<p>
The WSMA has created a suite of tools to help physicians comply with these rules, which you can <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Opioids/Prescribing_Rules_And_Guidelines/WSMA/Resources/Opioids/Prescribing_Rules_And_Guidelines/prescribing_rules_and_guidelines.aspx?hkey=dfe4668d-9a1a-43fe-9468-6c20117713e4">find here</a>.

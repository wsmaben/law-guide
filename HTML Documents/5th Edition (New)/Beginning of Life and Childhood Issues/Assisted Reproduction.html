<h1>Assisted Reproduction</h1>
<p><strong>What is assisted reproduction?</strong></p>
<p>
"Assisted reproduction" means a method of causing pregnancy other than sexual intercourse. The term includes:<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Artificial insemination;</li>
	<li>Donation of eggs;</li>
	<li>Donation of embryos;</li>
	<li>In vitro fertilization and transfer of embryos; and</li>
	<li>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What rules apply to consent for assisted reproduction?</strong></p>
<p>
Consent must be in record signed by a woman giving birth to a child conceived by assisted reproduction and an individual who intends to be a parent of the child.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> This requirement does not apply to a donor.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Failure of the person to sign a consent required by the parties above, before or after birth of the child, does not preclude a finding of parentage if the woman or individual proves by clear and convincing evidence the existence of an express agreement entered into before conception that the individual and the woman intend they both be parents of the child.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Parentage may also be found if the woman and the individual for the first four years of the child's life, including any period of temporary absence, resided together in the same household with the child and both openly held out the child as the individual's child.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
If the individual dies or becomes incapacitated before the child attains four years of age or the child dies before the child attains four years of age, a court may nevertheless find consent to parentage if a party proves by clear and convincing evidence that the woman and the individual intended to reside together in the same household with the child and both intended the individual would openly hold out the child as the individual's child, but the individual was prevent from carrying out that intent by death or incapacity.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>What is the parental status of the various parties where a child results from assisted reproduction?
</strong></p>
<p>
A donor is not the parent of a child conceived by means of assisted reproduction.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> A woman who donates eggs for assisted reproduction by another woman is not considered by law to be the natural mother of the child so conceived, unless the donor and the woman who gives birth to the child as the result of assisted reproduction have agreed in writing that the donor is to be a parent.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Such an agreement must be in writing and signed by the egg donor and the woman who gives birth to the child and any other intended parent of the child.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> The physician shall certify the parties' signatures and the date of the egg harvest, identify the subsequent medical procedures undertaken, and identify the intended parents.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> The agreement, including the affidavit (a voluntarily sworn declaration of written facts which can be used as evidence in court) and certification, must be filed with the registrar of vital statistics, where it must be kept confidential and in a sealed file.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>How is the parent-child relationship established between a child and a man or woman?
</strong></p>
<p>
The parent-child relationship is established between an individual and a child if:<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The individual gives birth to the child <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>;</li>
	<li>There is a presumption of the individual's parentage of the child in accordance with the requirements set forth under the Uniform Parentage Act;</li>
	<li>The individual is adjudicated a parent of the child;</li>
	<li>The individual adopts the child;</li>
	<li>The individual acknowledges parentage of the child in accordance with the requirements set forth under the Uniform Parentage Act; </li>
	<li>The individual's parentage of the child through assisted reproduction;</li>
	<li>The individual's parentage of the child through a surrogacy agreement; </li>
	<li>An unrebutted presumption of the individual's parentage of the child <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What must a physician who uses eggs harvested from a donor for an assisted reproduction certify?</strong></p>
<p>
The physician must certify the signature of the parties and the signatures must be attested by a notarial officer or witnessed.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> This acknowledgement of parentage may be contained in a single document or may be in counterparts and may be filed with the state registrar of vital statistics or simultaneously.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> This information will be kept confidential and in a sealed file.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>May HIV or STD testing of a sperm donor be disclosed?</strong></p>
<p>
Under limited circumstances, yes.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> HIV or STD testing of a sperm donor may be disclosed to a health care facility or health care provider that processes, procures, distributes or uses sperm for purposes of artificial insemination. See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/AIDS-HIV-STD.aspx">AIDS/HIV/STD</a>.

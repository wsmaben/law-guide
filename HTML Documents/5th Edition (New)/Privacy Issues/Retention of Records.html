<h1>Retention of Records</h1>
<p><strong>How long must a physician retain a patient's medical record?
</strong></p>
<p>
There are no specific statutory or regulatory requirements for how long a physician must retain a patient's medical record, which would include electronic medical records, except for the following:<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A physician must maintain a patient's medical record for at least one year after receipt of an authorization to release the record.</li>
	<li>A physician must maintain a patient's medical record during the pendency of a patient's request either to examine or copy the record or to correct or amend the record.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because a patient's medical record is essential for the defense of a medical malpractice action, however, the statute of limitations and statute of repose provides some guidance for how long physicians should retain patients' medical records.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> See <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Statute_Of_Limitations.aspx">STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</a>. As a practical guideline, physicians should retain medical records, including electronic medical records, and x-rays for at least:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>6 years from the date of a patient's death;</li>
	<li>10 years from the date of a patient's last visit, prescription refill, telephone contact, test, or other patient contact;</li>
	<li>21 years from the date of a minor patient's birth (applies to both obstetrical records and neonatal/pediatric records);</li>
	<li>Indefinitely if the patient is incompetent or if the physician is aware of any problems with a patient's care or has any reason to believe the patient may sue.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A physician should consider any contractual obligation to retain records imposed by their malpractice insurance policy, payor contracts, or other contracts. 
</p>
<p>
To be absolutely safe, a physician should, if at all possible, retain patients' medical records indefinitely. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, appointment books and computer scheduling records should be retained for at least 10 years. Such records are often the only source of documentation of canceled appointments, no-shows, or other pertinent information about a physician's schedule.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the Washington Medical Commission publishes suggested guidelines for retention of medical records (GUI2017-02), which is available here: <a href="https://wmc.wa.gov/policies-rules/">https://wmc.wa.gov/policies-rules/</a>. 
</p>
<p><strong>Must records be retained in their original form?
</strong></p>
<p>
No. The retained medical records do not need to be the original documents so long as the physician can present an accurate reproduction of the original records.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>How long must a hospital retain a patient's medical record?
</strong></p>
<p>
Under Washington law, a hospital must retain a patient's medical record as follows:<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the patient is an adult, a hospital must retain and preserve the medical record for at least 10 years following the patient's most recent discharge.</li>
	<li>If the patient is a minor, a hospital must retain and preserve the medical record for at least three years following the minor's 18th birthday, or 10 years following the patient's most recent discharge, whichever is longer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How long must a private alcohol and chemical dependency hospital retain a patient's medical record?
</strong></p>
<p>
A private alcohol and chemical dependency hospital must retain a patient's medical record as follows:<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Records of adult patients must be retained and preserved for a minimum of 10 years following the most recent discharge.</li>
	<li>Records of minors at the time of care, treatment, or diagnosis must be retained and preserved for a minimum of three years following the minor's 18th birthday, or 10 years following the patient's most recent discharge, whichever is longer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How long must a private psychiatric and alcoholism hospital retain a patient's medical record?
</strong></p>
<p>
A private psychiatric and alcoholism hospital must retain and preserve a patient's medical record as follows:<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Records of adult patients must be retained and preserved for a minimum of 10 years following the most recent discharge.</li>
	<li>Records of minors the time of care, treatment, or diagnosis must be retained and preserved for a minimum of three years following the minor's 18th birthday, or 10 years following the patient's most recent discharge, whichever is longer.</li>
</ul>

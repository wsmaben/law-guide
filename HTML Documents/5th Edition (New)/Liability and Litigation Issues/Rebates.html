      No. Under Washington law, it is both a misdemeanor
      <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and unprofessional conduct
      <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> for a physician to receive any
      rebate, refund, commission, unearned discount or profit or compensation
      for referring patients. The physician's license may even be revoked under

    <p><strong>What does Washington's anti-rebate law prohibit? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Under Washington's anti-rebate statute, it is a misdemeanor for any person
      or entity to pay, offer to pay, allow, request, or receive, directly or
      indirectly, any rebate, refund, commission, unearned discount or profit by
      means of a credit or other valuable consideration from a third party
      (someone other than the patient) in connection with:<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The referral of patients.</li>
      <li>
        The furnishing of any medical, surgical or dental care diagnosis,
        treatment or service.
      </li>
      <li>The sale, rental, furnishing or supplying of:</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: none">
        <ul>
          <li>Any clinical laboratory supplies or services of any kind.</li>
          <li>Drugs, medications or medical supplies.</li>
          <li>
            Any other goods, services or supplies prescribed for medical
            diagnosis, care or treatment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The statute does not prevent a patient from paying a physician for
      services rendered or prescriptions received, nor does it prevent a
      physician from making a profit on the furnishing of goods or care to a
      patient.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Are there any exceptions to Washington's anti-rebate
        prohibitions?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Under Washington's anti-rebate law, a physician who has an ownership
      interest in an entity which furnishes clinical laboratory or other
      diagnostic services may refer a patient to that entity, if and only
      if:<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The physician affirmatively discloses to the patient, in writing, the
        fact that the physician has a financial interest in the entity.
      </li>
      <li>
        The physician provides the patient with a list of effective alternative
        facilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The physician informs the patient that the patient has the option of
        using one of the alternative facilities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The physician assures the patient that the patient will not be treated
      differently if the patient chooses one of the alternative facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, generally, Washington's anti-rebate law does not prohibit partners
      who are licensed professionals or a licensed professional who employs
      another licensee from profiting off the professional services of their
      partner or employee.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Washington's anti-rebate law also does not prohibit any activity
      by an entity (other than a clinical laboratory licensed or certified under
      federal or state law) when the activity is allowed or does not violate the
      federal anti-kickback statute.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Does compliance with the exception to Washington's anti-rebate
        prohibition ensure compliance with either the Medicare-Medicaid
        anti-kickback law or the Medicare-Medicaid physician self-referral
        prohibitions?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. See

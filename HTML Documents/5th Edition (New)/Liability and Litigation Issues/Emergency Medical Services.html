        >What types of non-physician emergency service medical personnel are
        authorized to provide emergency medical care in Washington?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following types of non-physician emergency medical service personnel
      can be certified by the state to provide emergency medical care under the
      responsible supervision and control of licensed physicians or approved
      emergency medical services (EMS) medical program directors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First responders.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Emergency medical technicians.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Physician-trained advanced emergency medical technicians and
        paramedics.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> This includes a
        person who:
      </li>
      <li>
        Has successfully completed an emergency medical technician course;
      </li>
      <li>
        Is trained under the supervision of an approved medical program director
        according to training standards prescribed in rule to perform specific
        phases of advanced cardiac and trauma life support under written or oral
        authorization of an approved licensed physician; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Has been examined and certified as a physician's trained advanced
        emergency medical technician and paramedic, by level, by the University
        of Washington's school of medicine or the department of health.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Statutes and regulations set forth detailed training, certification, and
      continuing medical education requirements for such non-physician emergency
      medical service personnel.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >To what extent may a physician be held liable for acts or omissions of
        trained mobile EMS personnel under the physician's supervision and
        control?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The general rule is that no act or omission of any physician's trained
      advanced emergency medical technician and paramedic, or of any emergency
      medical technician or first responder, made in good faith while rendering
      emergency medical service under the responsible supervision and control of
      a licensed physician or an approved medical program director, will impose
      liability on:<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The physician's trained advanced emergency medical technician and
        paramedic, emergency medical technician, or first responder;
      </li>
      <li>The medical program director;</li>
      <li>The supervising physician or physicians;</li>
      <li>
        Any hospital or its officers, members of the staff, nurses, or other
        employees;
      </li>
      <li>Any training agency or training physician or physicians;</li>
      <li>Any licensed ambulance service; or</li>
      <li>
        Any federal, state, county, city, or other local governmental unit or
        its employees.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The general rule applies to acts or omissions made in good faith in the
      performance of actual emergency medical procedures, or in rendering
      services at the request of an approved medical program director in the
      training of emergency service medical personnel for certification or
      recertification. It does not apply, however, to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The commission or omission of an act not within the field of medical
        expertise of the particular emergency service personnel.<sup
          ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Any act or omission that constitutes either gross negligence or willful
        or wanton misconduct.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May a physician be held liable for failing to obtain consent to the
        rendering of emergency medical or surgical or health services?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, no. A physician is not subject to civil liability for failure
      to obtain consent in rendering emergency medical or surgical services
      where the patient is unable to give consent for any reason and no other
      person legally authorized to provide consent is reasonably available, so
      long as the physician has acted in good faith and without knowledge of
      facts negating consent.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>

        harmless those involved in training emergency service medical personnel
        for certification and recertification?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Health will defend and hold harmless approved medical
      program directors, delegates, or agents&mdash;including, but not limited
      to, hospitals and hospital personnel&mdash;in their capacity of training
      emergency service medical personnel for certification or recertification
      at the request of such directors for any act or omission made in good
      faith in the performance of their duties.<sup

        >May a physician be held liable for voluntarily providing emergency
        medical services?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, no, unless the acts or omissions constitute gross negligence or
      willful or wanton misconduct.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>

        >May retired physicians provide medical assistance during an emergency
        or a disaster?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) may issue a retired
      volunteer medical worker license to any person that:<sup
        ><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Held an active health care license within 10 years prior to his or her
        initial application for the retired volunteer medical worker license;
      </li>
      <li>
        Does not hold a current health care license, but does not have any
        restrictions on his or her ability to obtain an active license; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Registers as a volunteer emergency worker with a local organization for
        emergency services or management organization.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Retired volunteer medical workers can only perform the duties assigned,
      must be supervised, and may only perform the duties that were associated
      with their previous medical practice.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
      Retired volunteer medical workers will be required to maintain competency
      requirements that are established by the DOH. These requirements
      include:<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Every three years, a retired volunteer medical worker must complete a
        basic first-aid course, bloodborne pathogens course, and CPR course to
        renew his or her license; and
      </li>
      <li>
        A retired volunteer medical worker must submit a signed declaration to
        verify he or she meets the continuing competency education requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A physician who holds a retired volunteer medical license, and is
      registered as an emergency worker, is immune from liability for his or her
      actions while providing assistance in an emergency or disaster, or while
      participating in an approved training exercise or preparation for an
      emergency or disaster. This immunity does not apply to acts of gross
      negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.<sup

    <p><strong>Who may have a guardian? </strong></p>
    <p>
      A county's superior court may appoint a guardian for an incapacitated
      person. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> An "incapacitated"
      person is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A person under 18 years of age;
        <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> or
      </li>
      <li>
        A person whom the court determines has a significant risk of personal
        harm based upon a demonstrated inability to adequately provide for
        nutrition, health, housing, or physical safety;
        <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> or
      </li>
      <li>
        A person whom the court determines is at significant risk of financial
        harm based upon a demonstrated inability to adequately manage property
        or financial affairs. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Who is an "incompetent" person for purposes of giving informed consent
        for health care?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      For purposes of giving informed consent for health care, an "incompetent"
      person is: <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A person so affected by mental illness, developmental disability,
        senility, habitual drunkenness, excessive use of drugs, or other mental
        incapacity that caring for himself or herself or managing his or her
        property, or both, is impossible.
      </li>
      <li>A person who is "incapacitated" as set forth above.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Who may be a guardian?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Any suitable person over the age of 18, or any parent under the age of 18,
      may be appointed guardian of an incompetent patient.
      <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      A person may not act as guardian if he or she is of unsound mind or has
      been convicted of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.
      <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      The court may refuse to appoint a person as guardian if the court finds
      that person unsuitable. <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Can a guardian give informed consent?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Yes. If a patient is incompetent to give informed consent, a physician may
      obtain valid consent from the patient's court-appointed guardian.
      <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> A physician's duties to the
      guardian are the same as to the patient. The guardian must be informed of
      all material risks, benefits, and alternatives.
      <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> See
      <a
        href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Informed_Consent.aspx"
        >INFORMED CONSENT</a
      >. A consent form is valid if signed by the patient's court-appointed
      guardian. <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> A guardian may not
      involuntarily commit the alleged incapacitated person for mental health
      treatment, observation, or evaluation unless the procedures for
      involuntary commitment have been followed.
      <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> A guardian may not give
      consent to psychosurgery, to therapy or any other procedures that induce
      convulsions, or to any psychiatric or mental health procedures that
      restrict the patient's ability to move or, if the patient has been
      involuntarily committed, in any way restrict the rights granted to
      involuntarily committed patients under Washington law.
      <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> A guardian may authorize
      consent for electroconvulsive therapy, however, if the alleged
      incapacitated person consented to inpatient admission and
      electroconvulsive therapy in a mental health advance directive.
      <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Who may be an attorney-in-fact?</strong></p>
    <p>
      A person may designate another person to act as his or her
      attorney-in-fact by signing a document called a "power of attorney." The
      writing must show the intent of the person that the authority conferred on
      the attorney-in-fact shall be exercisable in the event of the person's
      later disability or incapacity. All acts done by the attorney in fact
      during any period of disability, incompetence, or uncertainty as to
      whether the person is dead or alive, have the same effect as if the person
      were alive, competent, and not disabled.
      <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >What should a physician do before relying on an
        attorney-in-fact?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician should be provided with a power-of-attorney that requests
      the physician to accept the attorney-in-fact's authority to act on behalf
      of the patient. The attorney-in-fact should also present a sworn affidavit
      verifying his or her identity and the conditions under which he or she has
      assumed the role of attorney-in-fact. Such conditions must include, among
      others, that the patient was competent and not under undue influence when
      the power of attorney was signed, and that the attorney-in-fact has no
      knowledge that the power-of-attorney has been revoked, modified, or
      limited. (See RCW 11.94.040 for the complete list of conditions.) Once the
      physician has examined the power-of-attorney and confirmed the identity of
      the attorney-in-fact, the physician may rely on the power-of-attorney, so
      long as that reliance is in good faith, and the physician has no reason to
      know that any of the statements in the sworn affidavit are untrue.
      <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >May a person authorize an attorney-in-fact to provide informed consent
        for health care decisions?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. A person may authorize his or her attorney-in-fact to provide
      informed consent for health care decisions on the person's behalf by so
      stating in the written power of attorney.
      <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following persons, however, may not act as the attorney-in-fact to
      provide informed consent for a person unless they are the spouse, state
      registered domestic partner, adult child, or brother or sister of the
      person:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The person's physicians.</li>
      <li>The physician's employees.</li>
      <li>
        The owners, administrators, or employees of the health care facility or
        long-term care facility where the person resides or receives care.
        <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>

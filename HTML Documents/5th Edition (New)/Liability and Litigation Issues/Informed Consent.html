    <p><strong>What is informed consent? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Informed consent is consent to treatment given by a patient or a patient's
      legal representative, after being fully informed in language the patient
      or patient's legal representative can reasonably be expected to
      understand, of all material facts relating to the treatment,
      including:<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The nature and character of the treatment proposed and administered.
      </li>
      <li>
        The anticipated results of the treatment proposed and administered.
      </li>
      <li>The recognized possible alternative forms of treatment.</li>
      <li>
        The recognized serious possible risks, complications, and anticipated
        benefits involved in the treatment proposed and the recognized possible
        alternative forms of treatment, including non-treatment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>When is informed consent required? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Generally, except in certain emergency cases
      <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> or when the patient requests not
      to be fully informed,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> informed
      consent is required before any treatment may be rendered to a patient.<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
      A physician's failure to obtain informed consent prior to treatment may
      subject the physician to liability in a medical malpractice action for any
      injuries caused by treatment to which the patient or the patient's legal
      representative did not consent.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Special informed consent is required in some instances. See
      <a
        href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/AIDS-HIV-STD.aspx"
        >AIDS/HIV/STD</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Who may give consent to treatment?</strong></p>
    <p>
      An otherwise competent adult patient may give informed consent to
      treatment.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a patient is not competent to give informed consent, informed consent
      may be obtained from one of the following persons in order of
      priority:<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The appointed guardian of the patient, if any.</li>
      <li>
        A person to whom the patient has given a durable power of attorney
        encompassing the authority to make health care decisions.
      </li>
      <li>The patient's spouse or state registered domestic partner.</li>
      <li>Children of the patient who are age 18 or older.</li>
      <li>Parents of the patient.</li>
      <li>Adult siblings of the patient.</li>
      <li>
        Adult grandchildren of the patient who are familiar with the patient.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adult nieces and nephews of the patient who are familiar with the
        patient.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adult aunts and uncles of the patient who are familiar with the patient.
      </li>
      <li>Another adult as further described in the next section.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the physician seeking informed consent for an incompetent patient makes
      reasonable efforts to locate and secure authorization from a competent
      person in the first or succeeding class of priority and finds no such
      person available, authorization may be given by any person in the next
      class in the order of descending priority.<sup
        ><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup
      >
      No person may provide informed consent if a person in a higher class of
      priority has refused to give such authorization.<sup
        ><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup
      >
      If there are two or more persons in the same class of priority, the

        >What are the requirements for another adult to provide informed
        consent?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Subject to the requirements above, another adult may provide informed
      consent if such adult is an individual who (a) has exhibited special care
      and concern for the patient, (b) is familiar with the patient's personal
      values, (c) is reasonably available to make health care decisions, (d) is
      not (i) a physician to the patient or an employee of the physician; (ii)
      the owner, administrator, or employee of a health care facility, nursing
      home, or long-term care facility where the patient resides or receives
      care; or (iii) a person who receives compensation to provide care to the
      patient; and (d) provides a declaration signed and dated within the last
      six months under penalty of perjury that recites facts and circumstances
      demonstrating that he or she is familiar with the patient and that he or
      she:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meets the requirements of items (a) through (d) above;</li>
      <li>Is a close friend of the patient;</li>
      <li>
        Is willing and able to become involved in the patient's health care;
      </li>
      <li>
        Has maintained such regular contact with the patient as to be familiar
        with the patient's activities, health, personal values, and morals; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Is not aware of a person in a higher priority class willing and able to
        provide informed consent to health care on behalf of the patient.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A health care provider may, but is not required to, rely on such a
      declaration. The health care provider or health care facility where
      services are rendered is immune from suit in any action, civil or
      criminal, or from professional or other disciplinary action when such
      reliance is based on a compliant declaration.<sup

    <p><strong>Are there special rules for homeless youth? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Yes. A minor is competent to provide informed consent in certain specific
      situations. Parental authorization or authorization from a person who may
      consent on behalf of the minor is required if the minor is under the age
      of thirteen.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> See

    </p>
    <p>
      If a minor is not otherwise authorized to provide informed consent for
      health care, including mental health care, such consent may be obtained
      from one of the following persons in order of priority:<sup
        ><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The appointed guardian, or legal custodian of the minor patient, if any.
      </li>
      <li>
        A person authorized by the court to consent for medical care for a child
        in an out-of-home placement.
      </li>
      <li>Parents of the minor child.</li>
      <li>
        A person to whom the parents have given a signed authorization to make
        health care decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        A competent adult representing himself or herself to be a relative
        responsible for the healthcare of the child, provided that the person
        sign a sworn statement to that effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        a school nurse, school counselor, or homeless student liaison with
        respect only limited outpatient services for a "homeless child or youth"
        not under the supervision or control of a parent, custodian, or legal
        guardian and is not in the care and custody of the department of social
        and health services, and,
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A physician may rely on the representation of a person who claims to be
      responsible for the healthcare decisions of a child, but is not required
      to do so.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> A physician who
      renders care to a minor, relying on consent obtained from a person who has
      signed such a sworn declaration is protected from legal action related to
      the consent.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Must informed consent be obtained in an emergency? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Not necessarily. Consent of the patient will usually be implied if an
      emergency situation exists requiring prompt treatment to avoid the
      possibility of injury or death and if the patient is unable to consent for
      any reason and no other person legally authorized to provide consent is
      reasonably available.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p><strong>How should informed consent be documented? </strong></p>
    <p>
      Signed consent forms may be used, but not in lieu of, or as a substitute
      for, a discussion with the patient.<sup
        ><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup
      >
      Signed consent forms should be kept in the patient's chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the patient requests not to be informed or to receive only limited
      information, the patient's request should be put in writing, signed by the
      patient, and placed in the patient's chart.<sup
        ><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Discussions with the patient about risks, benefits and alternatives should
      be documented with specificity in the patient's chart. The absence of
      specific contemporaneous documentation of informed consent discussions in
      medical malpractice actions alleging failure to obtain informed consent
      brought on behalf of patients who have died or become incompetent may
      prove difficult to defend. In such cases, absent such documentation, the
      physician may be barred by the deadman's statute from presenting evidence
      as to the details of what the physician told the patient,
      <sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> or as to the physician's
      habit and routine in informing similarly situated patients, about risks,
      benefits, and alternatives to the treatment proposed and administered.<sup

    <p>
      <strong
        >Must informed consent be given to involuntarily committed patients?

    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, yes. But see

      for circumstances where informed consent is not required. Informed consent

      <strong
        >Should a physician ever promise a patient a particular result from
        treatment or a cure?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Generally, the law presumes that a physician does not guarantee a
      particular result or cure. If, however, the physician promises the patient
      or the patient's legal representative that a particular injury will not
      occur, the physician may be liable for medical malpractice if the injury
      does occur.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>

Involuntary Commitment – Substance Use Disorder
</h1>
<p><strong>Who may be involuntarily committed for substance use disorder?
</strong></p>
<p>
Persons who are gravely disabled <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> as a result of substance use disorder (formerly known as chemical dependency) may be involuntarily committed.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> A person is deemed gravely disabled as a result of substance use disorder if, as a result of the use of alcohol or other psychoactive chemicals, there is a substantial risk that:<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon his or her own person, as evidenced by threats or attempts to commit suicide or inflict physical harm on oneself,</li>
<li>Physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon another, as evidenced by behavior which has caused such harm or which places another person or persons in reasonable fear of sustaining such harm,</li>
<li>Physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon the property of others, evidenced by behavior which has caused substantial loss or damage to the property of others, or</li>
<li>The person has threatened the physical safety of another and has a history of one or more violent acts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is the involuntary commitment process initiated for persons who, as a result of substance use disorder, are incapacitated?
</strong></p>
<p>
The involuntary commitment process for persons incapacitated by substance use disorder is usually initiated by the filing of a petition for commitment with the superior court by a county-designated substance use disorder specialist (CDS).<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> When the CDS receives information that a person is incapacitated as a result of substance use disorder, the CDS investigates and evaluates the facts.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> If the CDS determines that a person is incapacitated as a result of substance use disorder, the CDS may file a petition for commitment.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>May a physician detain a person who is brought into an evaluation and treatment facility or hospital emergency room who appears to be incapacitated as a result of substance use disorder?
</strong></p>
<p>
Unlike the statutes for involuntary commitment for mental disorders, the statutes governing involuntary commitment for substance use disorder do not specifically address whether a physician may detain a person to enable the county-designated CDS to evaluate the person. However, the petition alleging that substance use disorder treatment may be issued if there is an available secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program that has adequate space for the person. <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> An order requested by a designated crisis responder to detain a person with a substance use disorder to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program may be issued by a judge of the superior court if there is probable cause to support the petition and that person has refused or failed to accept appropriate evaluation and treatment voluntarily.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> The designated crisis responder may notify a peace officer to take a person who presents a likelihood of serious harm, or is gravely disabled to be taken into custody and placed in an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> At the time such person is taken into custody, a copy of the original order with a notice of rights and a petition for initial detention must be served on such person, his or her guardian, and conservator.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> The evaluation and treatment period for a person who has been detained to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program may not be more than seventy-two hours.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>May the parent of an adolescent initiate inpatient substance use disorder treatment of the adolescent without the adolescent’s consent?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. An adolescent is a minor that is 13 years old or older.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> A parent may bring, or authorize the bringing of, his or her adolescent child to a certified substance use disorder treatment program and request that an assessment be conducted by a professional person to determine whether the adolescent is chemically dependent and in need of inpatient treatment.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> Consent of the adolescent is not required for admission, evaluation, and treatment if the parent brings the adolescent to the program <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
An appropriately trained professional person may evaluate whether the adolescent is chemically dependent.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> Such evaluation must be completed within 24 hours of the time the adolescent was brought to the program unless the professional person determines that the adolescent’s condition necessitates additional time for evaluation.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> In no event may the adolescent be held longer than 72 hours for evaluation.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
If, in the judgment of the professional person, it is determined that it is a medical necessity for the adolescent to receive inpatient treatment, the adolescent may be held for treatment.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> Within 24 hours of completion of the evaluation, the professional person must notify DSHS if the adolescent is held for treatment and of the date of admission (redacting all patient identifying information unless the patient consents or unless permitted by federal law).<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
No provider is obligated to provide treatment to an adolescent brought to a substance use disorder treatment program by a parent. Nor may a provider admit an adolescent to treatment under such circumstances unless it is medically necessary.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
No adolescent receiving inpatient treatment under such circumstances may be discharged from the program based solely on his or her request.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>

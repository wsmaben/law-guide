	<h1>Addiction</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>Can a physician be disciplined for personal misuse of alcohol or drugs?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Yes.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> A physician's current misuse of alcohol, controlled substances or
		legend drugs is considered unprofessional conduct. See <a
			href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Unprofessional_Conduct.aspx">UNPROFESSIONAL
			CONDUCT</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, license holders voluntarily participating in an approved program without being referred by the Medical
		Quality Assurance Commission (MQAC) shall not be subject to disciplinary action <sup><a href="#fn2"
				id="ref2">2</a></sup> for their substance abuse, and shall not have their participation made known to
		the MQAC, if they meet the requirements set forth in law, and those of the program in which they are
		participating. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Does a physician have an obligation to report another physician's drug or alcohol problem to the
			Department of Health?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Since 2007 <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, all professions licensed by the Washington State
		Department of Health must report anyone else licensed by the Department of Health if there is actual knowledge
		of (i) any conviction, determination, or finding that that the other practitioner has committed an act of that
		constitutes unprofessional conduct; or (ii) the other practitioner may not be able to practice with reasonable
		skill and safety due to a mental or physical condition <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>. Provided there
		is no patient harm or sexual misconduct, reports of an inability to practice with reasonable skill and safety
		due to a mental or physical condition may be submitted to one of the approved impaired practitioner or voluntary
		substance abuse programs or to the Department of Health. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>
		The MQAC may impose disciplinary sanctions, including license suspension or revocation, on any physician who
		fails to make a required report.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> See <a
			href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Medical_Discipline.aspx">MEDICAL
			DISCIPLINE</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>What is the Washington Physician's Health Program?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The Washington Physicians Health Program (WPHP) began in 1986 as the Washington Monitored Treatment Program
		(WMTP), founded by concerned members of the Washington State Medical Association (WSMA).<sup><a href="#fn8"
				id="ref8">8</a></sup> Under the provisions of the above laws, the WPHP is able to provide a confidential
		conduit for healthcare practitioners so that they can get the help they need for their mental or physical
		condition.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> WPHP provides these services as a therapeutic alternative to
		discipline.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Washington Physician's Health Program is a program administered by a committee of physicians who have
		expertise in the treatment of alcoholism, drug abuse, and mental illness.
	</p>
	<p>
		The committee may receive and evaluate reports of physician drug or alcohol abuse or mental illness from any
		source, intervene in verified cases, refer physicians for treatment, and monitor the impaired physician's
		condition.
	</p>
	<p>
		The committee will report a physician to the Medical Quality Assurance Commission (MQAC) if the committee
		believes the physician is an imminent danger to the public because of drug or alcohol abuse or mental illness.
	</p>
	<p>
		The committee will also report a physician to the MQAC if the physician refuses to cooperate with the committee,
		if the physician refuses to submit to treatment,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> or if the
		physician's drug or alcohol abuse or mental illness is not substantially alleviated by treatment and the
		physician, in the opinion of the committee, is unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill and
		safety.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>May a physician who prescribes potentially addictive drugs be liable if the patient becomes
			addicted?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Yes <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>. If a patient becomes addicted to prescription drugs, the
		physician may be liable to the patient if the physician negligently prescribed the drugs or failed to warn of
		the addictive nature of the drugs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>May a physician prescribe drugs for himself or herself?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is unprofessional conduct for a physician to self-prescribe controlled substances or to misuse controlled
		substances or legend drugs.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> See <a
			href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Controlled_Substances.aspx">CONTROLLED
			SUBSTANCES</a>; <a
			href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Legend_Drugs.aspx">LEGEND
			DRUGS</a>; and <a
			href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Liability_And_Litigation_Issues/Unprofessional_Conduct.aspx">UNPROFESSIONAL
			CONDUCT</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>May a physician prescribe drugs for the physician's family members?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Washington law does not specifically prohibit a physician from prescribing drugs for the physician's family
		members. Caution should be exercised, however, to keep thorough medical records and to avoid manipulation by
		family members. See <a
			href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Controlled_Substances.aspx">CONTROLLED
			SUBSTANCES</a> and <a
			href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Legal/Physicians_Guide_to_Health_Law/Clinical_Practice_Issues/Legend_Drugs.aspx">LEGEND
			DRUGS</a>.

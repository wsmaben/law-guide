	Involuntary Commitment – Chemical Dependency
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Who may be involuntarily committed for chemical dependency?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Persons who are gravely disabled <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> as a result of chemical dependency may be involuntarily committed. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> A person is deemed gravely disabled as a result of chemical dependency if, as a result of the use of alcohol or other psychoactive chemicals, there is a substantial risk that: <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon his or her own person, as evidenced by threats or attempts to commit suicide or inflict physical harm on oneself,</li>
	<li>Physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon another, as evidenced by behavior which has caused such harm or which places another person or persons in reasonable fear of sustaining such harm,</li>
	<li>Physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon the property of others, evidenced by behavior which has caused substantial loss or damage to the property of others, or</li>
	<li>The person has threatened the physical safety of another and has a history of one or more violent acts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>How is the involuntary commitment process initiated for persons who, as a result of chemical dependency, are incapacitated? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	The involuntary commitment process for persons incapacitated by chemical dependency is usually initiated by the filing of a petition for commitment with the superior court by a county-designated chemical dependency specialist (CDS). <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> When the CDS receives information that a person is incapacitated as a result of chemical dependency, the CDS investigates and evaluates the facts. <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> If the CDS determines that a person is incapacitated as a result of chemical dependency, the CDS may file a petition for commitment. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>May a physician detain a person who is brought into an evaluation and treatment facility or hospital emergency room who appears to be incapacitated as a result of chemical dependency? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Unlike the statutes for involuntary commitment for mental disorders, the statutes governing involuntary commitment for chemical dependency do not specifically address whether a physician may detain a person to enable the county-designated CDS to evaluate the person. However, the petition alleging that chemical dependency treatment may be issued if there is an available secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program that has adequate space for the person. <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> An order requested by a designated crisis responder to detain a person with a substance use disorder to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program may be issued by a judge of the superior court if there is probable cause to support the petition and that person has refused or failed to accept appropriate evaluation and treatment voluntarily. <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> The designated crisis responder may notify a peace officer to take a person who presents a likelihood of serious harm, or is gravely disabled to be taken into custody and placed in an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program. <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> At the time such person is taken into custody, a copy of the original order with a notice of rights and a petition for initial detention must be served on such person, his or her guardian, and conservator. <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> The evaluation and treatment period for a person who has been detained to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program may not be more than seventy-two hours. <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>May the parent of a minor initiate inpatient chemical dependency treatment of the minor without the minor’s consent? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Yes. A parent may bring, or authorize the bringing of, his or her minor child, even one who is age 13 or older, to a certified chemical dependency treatment program and request that an assessment be conducted by a professional person to determine whether the minor is chemically dependent and in need of inpatient treatment. <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> Consent of the minor is not required for admission, evaluation, and treatment if the parent brings the minor to the program . <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	An appropriately trained professional person may evaluate whether the minor is chemically dependent. <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Such evaluation must be completed within 24 hours of the time the minor was brought to the program unless the professional person determines that the minor’s condition necessitates additional time for evaluation. <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> In no event may the minor be held longer than 72 hours for evaluation. <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	If, in the judgment of the professional person, it is determined that it is a medical necessity for the minor to receive inpatient treatment, the minor may be held for treatment. <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> Within 24 hours of completion of the evaluation, the professional person must notify DSHS if the child is held for treatment and of the date of admission. <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	No provider is obligated to provide treatment to a minor brought to a chemical dependency treatment program by a parent. Nor may a provider admit a minor to treatment under such circumstances unless it is medically necessary. <sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	No minor receiving inpatient treatment under such circumstances may be discharged from the program based solely on his or her request, <sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> but must be discharged immediately upon written request of the parent. <sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Does the state provide chemical dependency screening services for children? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Yes. The Department of Social and Health Services contracts for chemical dependency specialist services at each office of children and family services. <sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> The specialist conducts outpatient chemical dependency screening and assessments, among other designated duties. <sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>

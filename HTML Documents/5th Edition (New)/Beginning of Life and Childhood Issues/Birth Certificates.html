Birth Certificates 
</h1>
<p><strong>Is a physician responsible for filling out and filing a newborn's birth certificate?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Washington requires that all births within the state be registered immediately. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> So, within 10 days after a child's birth, the attending physician (or the physician's agent) must fill out a birth certificate and file it with the state registrar of vital statistics. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Along with the certificate, the physician must also provide the registrar with the mother's social security number. If the mother is married, or if there is a signed acknowledgement of paternity, or one has been filed with the state registrar of vital statistics, the birth certificate needs to include the father's name and date of birth, and the father's social security number. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
</p>
<p><strong>Are there certain birth certificate forms that physicians should fill out?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) has standard forms for use as birth certificates. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> These forms can be found on <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/BirthDeathMarriageandDivorce/Forms.aspx">DOH's website</a>. 
</p>
<p><strong>Are there penalties for failing to comply with birth certificate requirements?
</strong></p>
<p>
Yes. Failure to comply with birth certificate requirements is a misdemeanor; repeated violations may subject a physician to a fine of up to $250, imprisonment for up to 90 days, or both. <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Also, willfully providing false information for or making any false statement on a birth certificate is a gross misdemeanor. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
</p>
<p><strong>When a child is born to an unmarried mother, what must the attending physician do?
</strong></p>
<p>
The attending physician (or the physician's agent) must provide the mother and natural father with written and oral information furnished by the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) regarding the benefits, responsibilities, and legal consequences of having the child's paternity established. <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> The information the attending physician must provide can be found at: <a href="http://www.dshs.wa.gov/dcs/services/providers.asp">http://www.dshs.wa.gov/dcs/services/providers.asp</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The attending physician (or the physician's agent) must also provide an opportunity for the child's mother and the man claiming to be the father to complete an acknowledgement of paternity. <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> The acknowledgement must: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be a record signed by the woman who gave birth to the child and by the individual seeking to establish a parent-child relationship, and the signatures must be attested by a notarial officer or witnessed. <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> </li>
	<li>State that the child whose parentage is being acknowledged does not have a presumed parent other than the individual seeking to establish the parent-child relationship or has a presumed parent whose full name is stated and does not have another acknowledged parent, adjudicated parent, or individual who is a parent of the child, other than the woman who gave birth to the child. <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></li>
	<li>State that the signatories understand that the acknowledgment is the equivalent of an adjudication of parentage of the child and that a challenge to the acknowledgment is permitted only under limited circumstances and is barred four years after the effective date of the acknowledgment. <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> </li>
</ul>
<p>
The completed acknowledgment must be filed with the state registrar of vital statistics. <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> Once the acknowledgment is filed, the physician is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable costs. <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>
